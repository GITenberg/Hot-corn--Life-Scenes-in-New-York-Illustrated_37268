<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The growing taste for works of this kind&mdash;works intended
to promote temperance and virtue, to lift up the lowly, to
expose to open day the hidden effects produced by Rum, to
give narratives of misery suffered by the poor in this city&mdash;has
induced the Publishers to offer liberal inducements to
the author to use his powerful pen, and words of fire, to
depict his "Life Scenes," and embody them in a volume,
which, we are satisfied, will prove one of the most acceptable
to the moral portion of the community, ever published. It
is a work of high tone, that must do good. The peculiar
style of the author is as original as the tales of truth which
he narrates. It is unlike that of any other author, and
every page is full of fresh interest and thrilling narrative.</p>

<p>As a temperance tale, it has no equal. As such, we hope
it may prove but the commencement of a series. As an
expos&eacute; of life among the poor in this city, it will be read
with deep and abiding interest, in all parts of this country.
It is a work for the fireside of every family; a book that
commends itself to the heart.</p>

<p>No one who has read the "<span class="smcap">Hot Corn Stories</span>," as they
appeared in the <i>Tribune</i>, but will rejoice to have the opportunity
to possess them, and many more like them, all complete
and connected, in one handsome volume, such as we
now offer.</p>

<p>To a moral and religious public; to all who would promote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
temperance; to all who would rather see virtue than vice
abound; to all who have a heart to feel for other's woes;
to all who would have their hearts touched with sympathy
for the afflictions of their fellow creatures, "Life Scenes,"
as depicted in this volume, are respectfully commended, by</p>

<p>
THE PUBLISHERS.<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE"></a>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<p>"Oh, pshaw," says pretty Miss Impulsive, "I hate prefaces."
So do I. Nobody reads them; that is, nobody but
a few old fellows with spectacles. I would not write one,
only that some folks think a book looks not well without.
Well, then, I have written a great deal in my life&mdash;travels,
tales, songs, temperance stories, some politics, a good deal
upon agriculture, much truth, and some fiction, always in the
newspapers, never before in a book. I know that many, very
many, have read what I have written with pleasure, or else
"this world is awfully given to lying," for they have said so.
Will they read my <i>book</i>? That we shall see. If they do,
they must not criticise too closely. Remember that some of
the most thrilling sketches were written amid the daily scenes
and avocations of a city editor's office, for the paper in
which they first appeared, without any thought or design on
the part of the author of making a book;&mdash;that was the
thought of the publishers. They read the first sketches, and
judged, we hope rightly, if enlarged and embodied in a neat
volume, it would be appreciated as one of the best efforts, in
this book-making age, to do good.</p>

<p>If they have judged rightly,&mdash;if it <i>does</i> have that effect,&mdash;if
the public <i>do</i> appreciate the volume as they often have my
fugitive effusions,&mdash;then shall I be rewarded, and they may
rest assured, whenever they buy a volume, that a portion of
the purchase money will go to ameliorate the condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the poor, such as you will become acquainted with, if you
follow me in my walks through the city, as depicted in this
volume, which I offer most hopingly to all who do not
know, and most trustingly to all who do know him, who has
so often signed himself</p>

<h2>HOT CORN.</h2>

<p class="h3">LIFE SCENES IN NEW YORK ILLUSTRATED.</p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="h3">OUR TITLE.&mdash;THE STORY.</p>

<blockquote><p>"How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature."</p></blockquote>

<p>"It is a queer title for a book; what can it mean?" is the
exclamation of those who open it for the first time.</p>

<p>Visit this city&mdash;walk with me from nine o'clock till midnight,
through the streets of New York, in the month of
August, then read the first interview of the author with little
Katy, the Hot Corn girl, and the story of her life, and you
will not ask, "What does it mean?" But you may ask,
what does it mean that I see so many squalid-looking women,
so many tender children, so many boys, who with well directed
labor might work their way to fortune; or crippled men,
sitting upon the stone steps along the street crying, "Hot
corn! here's your nice hot corn&mdash;smoking hot, smoking
hot, just from the pot!" Your heart, if it has not grown
callous, will be pained as mine has been at the sights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
misery you will meet with, and you will then exclaim, "What
does it mean that I see these things in the very heart of this
great commercial city, where wealth, luxury, extravagance,
all abound in such profusion? Surely the condition of the
people, the ways and wants of the poor, cannot be known, or
they would be improved. Why does not somebody write a
book illustrating these 'Life Scenes in New York,' whose
every page shall be a cry, startling as this of 'Hot corn, hot
corn!' now pealing in the midnight air?"</p>

<p>So thought I; and so straightway set about the work, with
ample material at hand, and more accumulating at every
step. In writing a book, the first thought of the author is,
what shall be my title? What better could I have than
HOT CORN, since that was the inciting cry that waked my
pen to action, to paint these life scenes in vivid pictures, for
the world to look at and improve?</p>

<p>If, in my daily walks and midnight rambles, I have seen
revolting sights, the details of which are harrowing to your
soul as you read, so much the more need that they be opened
to your view. Wounds must be seen to be healed. Old sores
are often pronounced incurable, simply because they are old.</p>

<p>First, strip off their dirty covering, then probe and wash,
and then apply the healing balsam. If not already gangrened
from long neglect, you may save the patient's life, and
at all events, ease his suffering, and smooth his road to the
grave.</p>

<p>Be mine the task to strip and expose, and yours to wash
and heal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Of just such life scenes as I depict, there are enough transpiring
every night to fill a volume.</p>

<p>Come, walk with me, of an August evening, from the Battery
to Union Square, and you shall see all the characters of a
romance.</p>

<p>'Tis concert night at Castle Garden. Stand here a short
half hour, and look at the gay and smiling throng. There is
material for many a tale.</p>

<p>Three thousand robes of fine cloth, silks, gauze, and lace,
pass the Battery gates in one night, fluttering to the open sea
breeze, without one thought from those who wear them for
the poor little girl that sits shivering by the path, crying hot
corn, or vainly striving to beg one penny from the overflowing
purses that freely give dollars for amusement, and less than
nothing to misery, or for its annihilation. Little do they
think that this child has a mother at home, who once counted
one in just such a thoughtless throng.</p>

<p>Here might a chapter be written, but let us on; we shall
find plenty of subjects. If we stop to write the history of
that little girl and her mother, we shall fill our book before
we start.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia boat has just landed her passengers at
Pier No. 1., North River, and the crowd are coming up Battery
Place. Here is a picture of American character.
Every one is pushing forward as though there was but one bed
left in the city, and to obtain that he intended to outstride
and overreach all his fellow travellers. Take care, little hot corn
girl, or you will be run over, and your store trampled under-foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Bitter tears for your loss will run down your hollow
cheeks, but they will gain you no sympathy. The only
answer that you will get, will be, "Why didn't you get out of
the way, you little dirty brat&mdash;good enough for you." Yes,
good enough for you, that you have lost your entire stock of
merchandize; what business had you in the way of commerce,
or path of pleasure?</p>

<p>"But, sir," says benevolence in a drab bonnet, "you have
hurt the child."</p>

<p>"What if I have? She has no business in the way. She
is nothing but a hot corn girl; they are no better than beggars
and often are little thieves. Why don't she stay at home?"
Sure enough. Simply because necessity or cruelty drives her
into the street. Now your cruelty will drive her home to be
beaten by a drunken father, for your act of wanton carelessness.</p>

<p>Stand aside, my little sufferer, or you will be run over again.
Here comes a little dark skinned, black-eyed, black-haired
man, with life and death in his very step.</p>

<p>What magic power impels him forward. He is a Jew&mdash;a
dealer in second-hand clothes. Surely his business cannot be
so important that he need to upset little children, or step on
the gouty toes of slow-going old gentlemen, in his hurry to
get forward.</p>

<p>It is Friday night, his Sabbath has already commenced, he
can do no business&mdash;make no monish&mdash;to-night. He is not
in a hurry to reach the synagogue, that is closed, what then?
He has a Christian partner, and he wants to arrange a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
speculation for to-morrow. He has just received information
of a shipment of yellow fever patients' clothing, which will
arrive to-morrow or Sunday, and he wants his Christian partner
to look out on Saturday; on Sunday, the Jew will watch
the chance to buy the infected rags, which both will sell on
Monday at a hundred per cent profit.</p>

<p>"What, at the risk of human life? Oh, I can believe that
of a Jew, but certainly no Christian would do it."</p>

<p>There spoke the Christian reader. The Jew will say the
same, only reversing the character. No good Christian or
Jew either will do it; yet it will be done, and little beggar
girls will be run over in the hot haste to meet the coming
ship.</p>

<p>Walk on. The side-walks are crowded, and the street
between the curb-stones full of great lumbering omnibuses
and carriages, that go up and down all night for hire; but
there is a melancholy stillness in all the houses where wealth
and fashion, in our young days, lived in lamp-lighted parlors,
and diamonds flashed down upon the listener to music which
had its home in these gay dwellings, where happy looking
faces were seen through open windows. Iron shutters close
them now, and commerce wears a dark frown by gas light.</p>

<p>On the right is Wall street, where fortunes are made and
lost as by the turn of a card, or rattle of a dice box. It is
very thronged at noon day. It is very dull now. A few
watchmen tread slowly around the great banking houses,
working for a dollar a night to eke out a poorly paid day, by
guarding treasures that the owners would not watch all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
live long night for all the watchman is worth. But he must
watch and work; he has a sick wife at home, and four little
girls are growing up to womanhood and city life. God
knows for what!</p>

<p>A few express wagons, and more of these ever-going ever-coming
omnibuses, are coming out of Wall street to join
the great Broadway throng. And a pale-faced little girl
sits upon the steps of the Bank of the Republic, adding to
that constant cry, "Hot corn! Hot corn!" Now here comes
the Cerberus of this money palace. What possible harm to
his treasures, can this little poverty-clad girl and her sickly
looking little beggar boy brother do, sitting here upon the
cold grey, stone steps, with an appealing look to every passer-by
to give a penny or buy an ear of corn. Does he think
they are merely using their trade to plot mischief and
schemes to rob his vaults of their stores of gold? One
would judge so by the way he growls at them.</p>

<p>"Clear out, you dirty brats&mdash;away with you, lousy beggars&mdash;home
to your kennel, young thieves. Don't come on these
steps again, or I will throw your corn in the gutter."</p>

<p>Are these the words to work reform? They are such as
fall every day and night upon the ear of just such specimens
of the young sprouts of humanity, that vegetate and grow a
brief summer in the city, dying in some of the chill winters
of neglect, that come over their tender years, blighting, freezing,
killing. How little of the gold, Cerberus guards, would
serve to warm these two young children into useful life. How
little those who guard or use it, care for those they drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
unfeelingly away from their door steps&mdash;for what? They
have made it a place of convenience for their nightly trade.
Tired of walking, carrying a heavy pail between them&mdash;heavy
to them&mdash;it would be light, and were it all gold, compared
with that within&mdash;they have sat themselves down, and just
uttered one brief cry of "Hot corn, here's your nice hot
corn!" when they are roughly ordered to "clear out, you dirty
brats." Yes, they are dirty, poor, and miserable, children of
a drunken father&mdash;who made them so? No matter. They
are so, and little has that gold done to make them otherwise.</p>

<p>"Clear out&mdash;get off these steps, or I will kick you off."</p>

<p>They did so, and went over to the other side of Broadway,
and clung to that strong iron fence, and looked up three hundred
feet along that spire which points to heaven from Trinity
church. Did they think of the half million of dollars there
piled up, to tell the world of the wealth of New York city?
No, they thought of the poor, wretched room, to them their
only home, a little way down Rector street, scarcely a
stone's throw from this great pile, in a house, owned and
rented to its poor occupants by that great land monopoly, the
Rectory of this great church.</p>

<p>"Bill," says the girl, "do you see that gal? how fine she is
tittivated up. Don't she look like a lady? I know who she
is, Bill. Do you think when I gets a little bigger, the old
woman is going to keep me in the street all day and half the
night, peddling peanuts and selling hot corn? No, sir-ee.
I will dress as fine as she does, and go to balls and theatres,
and have good suppers and wine, at Taylor's, and lay a-bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
next day just as long as I please. Why not? I am as good-looking,
if I was dressed up, as she is."</p>

<p>"Why, Sal, how will you do that? You ha'n't got no
good clothes, and mother ha'n't got none, and if she had,
she wouldn't give 'em to ye."</p>

<p>"I don't care, I know how to get them. I know the
woman that owns every rag that street gal has got on her
back."</p>

<p>"Them ain't rags, them's silk, and just as good dress as
them opera gals had on, that went stringing along down
Broadway a while ago. I don't see how you can get sich,
'less you prig 'em. I'd do that if I had a chance, blessed
quick. How'd she get 'em, Sal?"</p>

<p>"I knows, and that's 'nuff."</p>

<p>Why should she not know? She had been to school long
enough to learn, and would be a very inapt scholar if she had
not learned some of the ways of the street, in thirteen years.
In thirteen years more she will be a fit subject to excite the
care of the Moral Reform Society, or become the inmate of a
Mary Magdalene asylum; perchance, of Randall's Island.</p>

<p>There is a history about these two children and their
parents, which you may read by and by. We cannot stop,
now. Let us walk on. Iron shutters&mdash;bolted, barred, and
strong locked doors, what piles of treasure lie just within.</p>

<p>At Maiden lane on the right, and Courtlandt street on the
left, more omnibuses come up, crowding their way into an
already overfull "Broadway."</p>

<p>Oh! what a scream. It is a woman's scream. A cry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
anguish&mdash;of horror, that chills the blood. It comes from the
apple woman at the corner, and yet she is not hurt. No one
is near her, the crowd is rushing to the centre of the street.
What for? An omnibus has run over a drunken man. This
is always enough to excite the sympathy of woman, and make
her cry out as with pain. It is pain, the worst of pain; it
comes from a blow upon the heart; worse than that, in this
case, for the man is her husband. He has just left her,
where he has been tormenting her for an hour, begging, coaxing,
pleading, promising, that if she would give him one
shilling, he would go directly home and go to bed, as soon as
he got something to eat. "Something to drink." No.
Upon his word, he would not touch another drop the blessed
night. She well knew the value of such promises. She well
knew that the corner grocery, where he would stop to buy the
loaf of bread, which he promised to share with the two children,
kept a row of glistening glasses and decanters upon the
same shelf with the loaves. "The staff of life," and life's
destroyer, side by side. She knew his appetite&mdash;she knew
the temptation to which he would be subjected, she knew he
could not resist, she knew the vampire who dealt in life and
death, would suck up that shilling, if with it came the
heart's blood of him, her, and their two children. She
knew her husband, he could not resist the temptation.
Once sober and he could keep so, if the means of intoxication
were kept out of his sight. Once drunk and he would keep
so, as long as he could obtain a shilling to pay for the poison.
His last resource was to beg from his wife's scanty profits, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which she mainly supported the family, who often went supperless
to bed, for the rent must be paid. Landlords are
inexorable. Hers was worth so many millions that the
income was a source of great care, how it should be disposed
of. Her rent was coming due, and every shilling looked to
her of tenfold value to-night. Her children are in the street,
filling the night air with an appealing cry, "Hot corn, hot
corn, who'll buy my nice hot corn?" Her husband was begging
for one more shilling to waste&mdash;worse than waste&mdash;to close an
ill-spent day. Oh, what a contrast between this and their
wedding day!</p>

<p>She resisted his importunity until he found 'twas no avail,
and then he swore he would upset her little store in the gutter,
if she did not give him the money. What could she do?
She would not call an officer to take him away. No, she
could not do that, he was her husband. She could not
resist him, could not have an altercation in the street, that
would draw an idle crowd around her, spoil her trade, and
worse than that, let the world know that this bloated, ill-looking,
miserable remnant of a man, was her husband.
Shame did what persuasion or fear could not: she gave him
the shilling, and he started to cross the crowded street. He
heeded little of danger&mdash;he had often crossed when more
drunk than now&mdash;he heeded not the tripartite crush of carriages
coming up and going down these streets, all meeting in
a sort of vortex at that point. He heard, or heeded not, the
drivers, "hi, hi, hi, get out of the way, you drunken son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>a&mdash;&mdash;," and down he went among the horses' clattering feet,
upon the slippery stones, and the wheels passed over him,
crushing bones&mdash;human bones, and mangling flesh, and mixing
human blood with street dirt.</p>

<p>The omnibuses turned aside, the passengers shuddered as
the poor wretch was lifted up, covered with blood and dirt,
and inquired, "Is he dead?" The drivers looked down coolly
from their high seats, with a consoling remark, that, "it's
nothing but a drunken man," yet, that drunken man was that
woman's husband; him who, fourteen years ago, walked the
streets as well dressed, as proud, as sober as any in the crowd
who now gaze carelessly upon his bruised form, and hear the
remark, that he, "is nothing but a drunken man."</p>

<p>Fourteen years ago&mdash;yes, this very night&mdash;that woman
walked this very street, arm in arm, with that man, and
heard him, for the first time, call her wife. It was a happy
time then, and "all was merry as the marriage bell." Little
thought they then&mdash;less thought they a year afterwards,
while rocking the cradle in their own happy home, that the
time would come when he would raise his hand in anger to
strike that loving wife, or that child would be driven, with
kicks and curses, into the streets, or that he would lie bleeding
upon the pavement he had so often and so proudly trod
before, a poor mangled drunkard.</p>

<p>Oh how those words&mdash;joyous words&mdash;first rung in that
happy mother's ears, when the proud father said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you got a baby?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Willie, <i>we</i> have got a baby."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>How these words have rung like electric sparks through
many a happy heart.</p>

<p>"Have you got a baby?" said a little girl to a gentleman
riding out of Boston. It was a queer question, arising
as it did from a child he overtook on the road. How his city
friends would have laughed at him if they had heard the
question&mdash;"Have you got a baby?" No he had got no baby,
yet he was a man full forty years of age, and looked as
though he might have been a father, and so thought the
little girl. Yet he had no baby. Why? He was a bachelor!
So he had to answer, "no, my pretty miss, I have got
no baby." "Oh la, haven't you? Well <i>we</i> have. We have
got a baby at <i>our</i> house!!"</p>

<p>This was not interesting to a bachelor. How different it
would have been if he had married Lucy Smith, whom he
intended to a dozen years ago, but he was too busy then&mdash;too
intent upon making money enough, to support a wife before
he got one. Nonsense! How little he knew of the sweet
music of the words, "have you got a baby?" How her heart
would have leaped up and choked her utterance if she had
now been riding by his side as his wife, instead of his "old
flame," Lucy Smith! Lucy Smith, still, for she had never
heard those words touchingly applied to her, "have you got
a baby?" nor had she ever heard a sweet little girl say of her,
"we have got a baby at our house!"</p>

<p>How many a mother's heart has leapt for joy, at that question,
when she could answer it, "Yes, I <i>have</i> got a baby!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>How many a father's heart will be touched with emotion
when he reads, "Have you got a baby?" for he will think
as I do, of a time when, returning from a long journey, he
meets just such a little cherub of a girl at his own gate, who
does not stop to ask him how he does, nor climb his knee for
the accustomed kiss, so exuberant is her joy&mdash;so anxious is
she to possess him with the secret that wells up and fills her
very existence to overflowing, so that she must speak or burst,
and hence she watches for Papa, and runs out to meet him at
the gate with such a smile&mdash;such a joyous, glorious smile,
and cry of "Oh, Papa, we have got a baby!!" How many
a mother's heart will swell and throb, and how the warm
tears&mdash;tears of joy and gladness&mdash;will flow as she hears that
husband's footstep approach, for she knows he will say, "<i>Have</i>
you got a baby?"</p>

<p>But there is no such joy now for that mother's heart. Yet
that is the same father&mdash;fallen, trampled, dying, and she
rushes to the rescue.</p>

<p>Two police officers bear him to the side-walk and lift him,
lifeless as he is, upon a hand-cart. How the idle crowd push
and jostle each other to get a sight of the wounded man.
What for? To administer to his wants; to give, if need be,
something to minister to his relief? No. To gratify curiosity&mdash;morbid,
idle curiosity.</p>

<p>How this woman pushes and struggles to break the circle,
crying, "Let me in, let me in; let me see him." How little
the crowd heed her. They think it is curiosity, too, nothing
but curiosity, that impels her, as it does themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Why don't she say, "It is my husband?" and then they
would give her room, or the officers would make them.
Why! why don't she say it? She is ashamed to tell unfeeling
hearts how low she has been sunk in the world since first
she called that man by that name, or heard those heart-touching
words when their first child was born.</p>

<p>Husband was a sweet word once; it is a bitter one now;
yet it must be spoken, for they are about to bear him away
to the hospital. Whether dead or alive she knows not, and
she rushes madly forward, seizing the policeman, with a cry
of, "No, no; not there, not there; take him home, I will take
care of him&mdash;nobody can take care of him so well as I can.
Oh, let me take him home! Do let me take him home."
What could she do with him in her one room, the home of
herself and children. She could not stay to nurse him day
after day, for then her trade would be lost; somebody else
would take her stand; there would be no income, all would
be outgo, and all would soon be exhausted; nothing to buy
bread, nothing to pay rent, and then out must go the whole,
sick or well; they must go in the street if they fail to meet that
dreaded periodical&mdash;the rent day. There is no help for it.
All this is hastily considered, and there is no other way; he
must go to the hospital. 'Tis a blessed institution&mdash;a noble
honor to the city, charitably sustained, to give relief to&mdash;who?
A thousand just such subjects as this; made drunk, covered
with gore, maimed with broken limbs, by a legalized traffic
in hell's best aid on earth. A trade that fills jails, thieves-dens,
and brothels, and furnishes subjects like this for hospitals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"He must go to the hospital."</p>

<p>"Then I will follow and nurse him there."</p>

<p>There spoke the wife, as, ever since that holy name was
known, the wife has spoken&mdash;can speak alone.</p>

<p>How can she go?</p>

<p>Something clings to her dress and pulls her back. She
looks around upon a little boy and girl&mdash;it is the hot corn
girl, just driven from the banking-house steps three squares
below.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, do speak to us; it is Bill and me. Is
father dead? What killed him?"</p>

<p>Rum! She did not say so. She only thought. She
thought, too, of her helpless children, and what would they
do if she went to take care of their father. She did not think
of the blows, the kicks, and cuffs, and curses, received from
him during long bitter years, for they were given by&mdash;not by
him&mdash;not by her husband&mdash;but by the demon in him&mdash;the
devil engendered by rum. She thought nothing of the cruel
neglect and poverty and suffering of herself and children, for
that was a sequence of the other. She did think of this night,
fourteen years ago. She did think of the night when this girl,
now clinging to her dress and convulsively crying, "Mother,
is he dead," was born, for then she was a happy wife and
mother. Then that father took that child in his arms and
kissed and blessed it&mdash;then he took her in his arms and
kissed and loved her, and called her his dear wife. She did
not think of the night when that little slender boy, now ten
years old, was born, for then a devil&mdash;not a husband&mdash;dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
her by the hair, while in labor, from her poor cot, and bid
her go out in the pitiless storm to fill his bottle for him. No,
she did not remember that; she only remembered that he
was her husband; wounded, dying husband, in need of some
kind hand to make his bed and smooth his passage to the
grave, and she would leave all without a thought to follow
him to the hospital. She was his wife. Now there is a struggle
between duty and affection&mdash;between husband and children.
She cannot go with both. One must be neglected;
which shall it be? Had the husband been what he was
when that girl was born, the heart of many a wife would give
the ready answer. She looked upon her and remembered
the time when she first heard these words, "Have you got a
baby?" She looked upon her, and all intervening time faded
from memory, and she thought and felt as she would have
felt if he had been struck down that night. She tears herself
away from the grasp of the little girl, telling her to pick up
the apples and go home, she must go with father.</p>

<p>Another hand clings to her dress, and looks up with such
an appealing look and says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't go, mother; they will take care of father. Don't
leave us."</p>

<p>She looked upon her sickly boy, and thought of the night
he was born. Why does she start and turn round? Did
some one pull her by the hair? No, it was only fancy. A
sort of magnetic influence, linked with thought. That twinge
decided her. That twinge decided his fate, and saved her
children's lives. She went home with them, and tired nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
slept in spite of mental agony. At four o'clock the bells rung
for fire; it was long before she could wake sufficiently to
count the eight strokes which told it was in her district.
Dreamily unconscious of danger, she moves not till she hears
a crash and sees a light through the small rear window,
when she springs up, opens the door, looks out in the direction
of the stairs, and meets a burst of flame and smoke
coming up. Back, back to the bed, closing the door&mdash;a thin
pine door&mdash;the only barrier between the fire and her sleeping
babes, she drags them out and up to the window. Will she
throw them down upon the pavement below, as the only hope
of saving their lives, for the fire is fairly up the stairs and
rattling at the door behind her? If it enters all is lost. The
window is opened, and the little boy first&mdash;he is the darling&mdash;poised
upon the sill, in the bewildered amazement of half-awaking
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Oh mother, mother, don't throw me out! I will be a
good boy, mother. I never will tear my jacket again.
Indeed I could not help it. It was a big boy that pulled me.
Oh, mother, mother, don't, pray don't."</p>

<p>He screams with fear, as he hangs convulsively upon his
mother's neck, and looks down upon the gathering crowd,
crying, "Throw him out, throw him out; we will catch him."
And a hundred hands are outstretched, a hundred noble hearts
would prostrate themselves upon the pavement to save, to
break the fall of a beggar boy whom they would have kicked
out of their path the day before. Now a mother appeals to
her fellow men to save her child. She had oft appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
before, but then the house was not on fire; the fire was in his
father's mouth&mdash;and that they heeded not. No bells rung,
to call the engines with copious streams of water to put it out&mdash;they
are ringing now. And now see the outstretched
hands, each ready to risk its own life to save that of a child.</p>

<span class="caption">THE NEW-YORK FIREMAN.</span>
</div>

<p>"Let him go&mdash;throw him out&mdash;you will all burn up in five
minutes more&mdash;this old wooden house burns like tinder."</p>

<p>She looks behind her; the flame is sending serpent tongues
under the door. Her dress upon a chair is on fire&mdash;now the
bed. They must jump, naked too, down among those men,
or die.</p>

<p>"Hold on! hold on! Way there&mdash;give way there.
Hurrah, men! lively now!"</p>

<p>Oh, that was a sight for that mother and her two children.
A ladder company thundered down the street with their cry
of "Way there!" for they have caught the sight of a woman
and children in distress; and oh! how they do press forward,
shouting, "Way there! lively now! Hold on, we will save
you!" How quick, after they reach the spot, a ladder is
loosened and off the carriage, with one end on the ground
and the other going up, up&mdash;"Up with her now!" and so they
do. Before it has found a resting-place, a man, active as a
cat, is halfway up. Now he is at the top; now&mdash;hurrah!&mdash;how
the shouts rend the air, for he has the boy in one arm
and the girl in the other, and tells the mother to follow. She
hesitates. What for? The noble fireman sees at a glance,
stops a moment, pulls off his coat and throws it to her&mdash;"now"&mdash;down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>they go&mdash;now they are safe. Safe with life&mdash;not
a thing else on earth but her two fatherless children, her
only covering a fireman's coat. Where is her husband now?
Where he will never see them again; for while his attendant
slept he tore the bandages from his wound, and then slept
himself&mdash;a sleep that one voice alone will awaken. Judge
him not harshly; he was the victim, not the criminal. He is
dead now, tread lightly upon his grave.</p>

<p>Look to his wife and children. It is they who need your
sympathy. Raised in the worst school on earth&mdash;the streets
of this city, some of the Life Scenes of which I aim to depict&mdash;the
boy has already learned to "prig;" and, so he shared the
proceeds with his father&mdash;that father, or rather the monster
who made him a devil, would encourage the boy to be a
thief. What could the mother do to counteract such deleterious
influence? All day she must stand at her corner, selling
fruit, pea-nuts, and candy, to make bread to feed her else
starving offspring, and to keep her husband out of the prison
or alms-house.</p>

<p>You have already seen the effect of the street education
upon Sally; the sight of her playmate, Julia Antrim, dressed
in silks and laces, although borrowed&mdash;no, furnished, by "the
woman," on hire, for a purpose more wicked than murder, for
murder only kills the body&mdash;has already tempted her towards
the same road&mdash;to that broad path to woe; not in the future,
but here present with us every day; and she has already
determined that she will follow it as soon as "she gets big
enough."</p>

<p>Who shall rescue her?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The danger is still more imminent now. Houseless, naked,
starving in the street, how shall she live? One step, one resolution,
will take her to the clothes-lending harpy, who fattens
upon the life-blood of young girls, whom she dooms to the
fate of Ixion for the remainder of their lives; for her garments
are the shirts of Nessus to all who wear them.</p>

<p>She feels that she <i>is</i> big enough now&mdash;big enough to begin.
Younger girls than her are night-walkers. Julia is no older,
and but little bigger, and she has often stopped in her walk
to eat hot corn or pea-nuts with Sally, and show her shining
gold, trying to tempt her to go and do likewise. She has an
interest, too, in the temptation, for she has told Mrs. Brown
of her old playmate, Sally Eaton, and how good-looking she
was; and Mrs. Brown has been to see her, has bought her
merchandise, and spoken words of soul-trapping flattery, and
promised Julia a present of a new silk dress&mdash;that is, just as
good as new, it had just been bought by a girl whom she
turned out of doors because she could not pay her way&mdash;if
she will coax Sally to come and live with her.</p>

<p>And so she has been sorely tempted. Eve was so, and fell.</p>

<p>These tempting words are now running through the brain of
Sally, as she stands in the crowd, wrapt in a blanket, kindly
lent her, with her mother and little Willie, looking at their
home and every earthly thing going up in flame and smoke
heavenward. Her mother weeps, for the first time in long
years. Long, long, had she steeled her heart against such
indulgence; its pent up fountains burst now. Not for grief;
no, they were tears, such as she shed when that girl was born.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
How she cried, and thanked God, and pressed the hand of the
fireman and thanked him for saving her children's lives, dearer
to her than all her household goods.</p>

<p>How little he thought of the noble act. He almost
repulsed her and her gratitude.</p>

<p>"There, that'll do, old woman. You had better be getting
in somewhere."</p>

<p>Somewhere! Yes, somewhere! Where?</p>

<p>That is the question. The crowd shout at the heroic deeds
of the firemen, and would carry them in triumph through the
streets, or bring out baskets of champaigne to drink libations
to their honor, for saving two helpless children from the
flames. Saved for what? To stand naked in the street!
No. Let them go to their friends. They have none. Yes,
they have, but not relatives. A few dollars are put into the
mother's hand, but who will take her in? who will give her a
home? One that three years ago had no home himself.
One who had been more drunken than Bill Eaton&mdash;had been
drunk for forty years. He is sober now&mdash;you shall hear
directly how he became so.</p>

<p>A man advanced in years, say more than half a century,
followed by a tall, fine-formed, well-dressed, bright-eyed girl,
about one-third her father's age, press through the crowd to
where the widow and her children stand, take them by the
hand and lead on, with the simple words, "Come with us."</p>

<p>It needs but few such words, spoken in such kind tones, to
the afflicted to lead them into paths of peace, and hope, and
joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother went forward with a sort of mechanical
motion of the limbs, unaided by any impulse of the mind.
Willie followed, as the lamb follows the ewe, whether to
green fields or the butcher's shambles.</p>

<p>Sally was more independent. She was on the point of
being entirely so, but a moment before. Now she clung to
her girlish companion, as the wrecked mariner to hope. Had
hope come one minute later, she had been led by the tempter
that was gnawing at her heart-strings, to slip away from her
mother, and in one hour afterwards, she would have been
knocking at the ever-ready-to-open door of Mrs. Brown, and
once passing that threshold, woe, woe, woe, had been written
upon every page of her life. Once having passed that door,
every other but its like had been closed against her for ever.
For the sin of entering that door, in her young years, the
world would never forgive her. No matter, that gaudily
dressed and luxuriously fed tempters had beset her and led
her in. Such tempters&mdash;such school teachers for city children
are allowed to monopolise the Broadway sidewalks, and
hold their infant evening schools, if not by authority of the
common council, at least by permission and countenance of the
chief of police and all his "stars." No Proserpine can walk
this street at night alone, without meeting, or at least subjecting
herself to, the sad fate of Proserpine of old.</p>

<p>Few of those we meet in our late walks, are Proserpines or
Vestas; although they may be goddesses of fire.</p>

<p>Seek not to lift the veil, you will find Pandora there;
Blame not the girl who got her teachings in such a street, if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in her deep adversity she was tempted&mdash;tempted to leave that
mother and brother, and slip away in the crowd, to go where
she knew she would find a home. Where else should she
go? She knew of none. No one of all that crowd offered to
take her home with him. She had no hope. She was a fit
subject for despair, and despair is the father of temptation.
What a blessed thing is hope, charity, and a will to do good;
when it flows from one young girl to another!</p>

<p>But who is it says, "come with us?" The voice seemed
familiar, and yet not familiar to Sally's ear. If the person
had been clothed in such a garb of poverty as she herself had
always worn, she would have known her, although it was three
years since they had met. She was not; she wore a neat
tidy calico frock, and clean white sun-bonnet, hastily put on,
and altogether looked so neat, so smart, so comfortable, as
though she had a home which she meant to take them to,
when she said, "come with us," that the tempter's spell was
broken. Sally would not have gone with Julia Antrim, for all
her gold and silks, good suppers and other enjoyments. The
words were few and common-place. How often the mother
and children had heard them before&mdash;"come with us." But
they never sounded as they did this night. There is something
in the tone, as well as words. There is a magnetic
power in kindness. Kind words are always winning, whether
from friend or stranger. These came from strangers. Not
altogether so; the man had been one of the drunken companions
of Bill Eaton; had helped to make him such, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
now he was going to pay part of the damage to his family.
The girl, in her father's drunken days, had been one of Sally's
street companions; they had begged, and stole, and peddled
hot corn and pea-nuts together. But Sally knew her not.
How could she? Then she was, ragged and dirty, far worse
than Sally; her parents were far poorer, and lived in a worse
room, one of the worst in Centre street, and both of them
were great drunkards, and she was, so everybody said, "the
worse child that ever run unhung."</p>

<p>How could she know the well behaved, nice looking young
lady, walking by her side. But she did know that she spoke
kind words in a sweet tone, and her heart was touched, and
she went on with a light step. That blanket wrapped a
happier heart that night, than ever fluttered under the silk
dress of her former playmate, Julia Antrim.</p>

<p>They went on; the old man gave his arm to the widow and
led the little boy; the daughter walked with Sally. They
enter the <i>front</i> door of a good house&mdash;when did either ever
enter the front door before&mdash;up one flight of clean stairs, and
there is their home, a room, and two bed-rooms, and kitchen;
small to be sure, but a most comfortable home, for the old
man and his daughter. He was a carpenter, and made from
a dollar and a half to two dollars a day; she was a stock-maker,
and could earn from three to five dollars a week,
enough to pay nearly all expenses. "Three years ago," said
he, "I was the most hopeless drunkard that ever tumbled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>into a Centre street cellar. And my wife&mdash;but no matter&mdash;she
is in heaven now. All that girl's work. She reformed
us; she made me a sober man, and, God willing, I shall never
fill a drunkard's grave."</p>

<p>"Oh, if she could only reform my husband, how I would
bless her."</p>

<p>"It is too late."</p>

<p>"No, no; it is never too late; while there is life there is
hope."</p>

<p>"Yes, true; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what? what is it? what do you know?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, ma'am, I was in the crowd last night when
the accident happened. It was me that first picked him up;
and so, you see, I went up with him. It was me that told
you that you couldn't go, 'cause I knew how 'twas with the
children, and how you hadn't much to do with at home; for I
had been sort o' watching Bill, and he had promised to go with
me this very night to sign the pledge; and so, you see, I went
up with him, and they dressed his wounds, and I knew he
wouldn't get over it, his blood was so bad, and it was so
warm; but he might have lived a while, and so when they got
things fixed, I thought I would come down and tell you about
it; but just as I got down to the gate, a fellow came running
after me to go back&mdash;it was a'most morning then&mdash;and so
back I went. They said he had got crazy while I was in the
room with another old friend, and when&mdash;when I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see; he is dead."</p>

<p>"Yes; he is dead. When I came back he was about gone,
but he was just as rational as I am now. 'Oh, Jim,' said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
'Jim Reagan, if I had only taken the pledge when you did,
I should have been a man now. But I am glad I am going.
My folks will be a great deal better off without me.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! he was my husband&mdash;their father&mdash;he
might have reformed."</p>

<p>"Tell them," said he, "that I am dying, and that for the
first time in ten years I feel as though I had my senses. If I
could see them and know they forgave me all the wrongs I have
inflicted upon them! Do you think my wife could forgive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; everything, everything."</p>

<p>"So I told him, and that seemed to quiet him. And then
I begged him to forgive me for what I had done towards
making him a drunkard. 'Oh,' says he, 'I can forgive everybody&mdash;even
those who used to sell it to us, who used to take
the bread out of our children's mouths for liquor, but I never
can forgive those who made the law, or licensed them to murder
us. I forgive everybody else that ever injured me, and
I die in peace. Tell my wife I die loving her. God bless her
and my poor children, what will become of them? Good bye,
Jim; go and see my wife, and tell her good bye, and that I
die as I wish I had lived; but it is too late, too late. God
bless my wife!'</p>

<p>"I could not speak, I turned my eyes away a minute,
looked again, and poor Bill Eaton was gone&mdash;gone to Heaven,
I am sure, if sincere repentance would take him there.
Well, you see, I could not do anything more for poor Bill, for
he was gone where we must all go pretty soon, and so I come
down and waked up Maggie."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a start&mdash;a sudden wakening up to consciousness
on the part of Sally, she had recognised the name.</p>

<p>"And says I, Maggie, daughter, come get up, and go with
me to see a poor widow and children in distress. Oh, I wish
you could have seen how she bounded out of bed&mdash;we sleep
in beds, good clean beds, now, and how quick she dressed
herself, and how neat, and cheerful, and pretty she looked, and
how sweetly she said, 'now, father, I am ready, who is it?'
and when I told her, how her heart bounded with joy, and
then she told me she knew Sally, but had not seen her for a
long time, and so, arm in arm, we went out, and you know the
rest. Poor Bill!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that I could have seen him&mdash;could have heard him
speak soberly and affectionately once more&mdash;I think I could
have given him up without a murmur."</p>

<p>"No. You would not have been willing to give him up to
die, just as he had begun to live. Be content, you must not
murmur. Who knows but all this overwhelming affliction
will work together for your good, and your children's good."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I am sure it will for mine. It has already,
for I will be like Maggie; don't you remember Maggie?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't recollect but one Maggie&mdash;'Wild Maggie of
the Five Points'&mdash;the most mischievous, ragged, dirty little
beggar in all that dreadful neighborhood; and her father, the
most filthy drunkard I ever saw. Why he was a great deal
worse than&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Your husband. Speak it out, I am not ashamed to own
it, now I have reformed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"You&mdash;you, not you; this is not Maggie."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, this is 'Wild Maggie,' and this is her
father. This nice young lady, that said so sweetly, 'Come
with us,' this is 'Wild Maggie,' and this is&mdash;is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Old Jim Reagan, the miserable old drunkard, that used to
live in a miserable cellar, in Centre street, and finally got
turned out of that, and this is Maggie, and this is our home."</p>

<p>And he looked around proudly upon the comforts of this
home, and contrasted them with the miseries of that.</p>

<p>Now Margaret&mdash;Mag or Maggie, no longer&mdash;began to "fly
around." Breakfast was to be got, and what was much more
difficult, a full-sized woman, a half-grown girl, and a quarter-grown
boy, were to be clothed. How was it to be done?
One of her dresses, "with a tuck,"&mdash;tucks are fashionable in
these days&mdash;was soon made to fit Sally. The father said, he
would go out and get some clothes for Mrs. Eaton and little
Willie, for, thank God, he was able to do it, for what he saved
by soberness, not only enabled him to live and clothe himself,
but to fulfil that best of all Christian injunctions, to be kind
to the widows and fatherless, and he did not know of any
that he was under more obligations to than the wife and children
of Bill Eaton, and, God willing, he was going to clothe
them, and then he was going to go with them to Mr. Pease,
the man that had been the means of reclaiming him, and
get them a home in the House of Industry, until they
could find some other one, or a way to earn a living.</p>

<p>Apparently it was not willed that he should spend his
scanty store to clothe the naked at this time; the will to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
so was equally acceptable to the great Will, as though the
deed were done, for just now there was a rap at the door,
indicating an early visitor. Who could it be? Margaret ran
down to see. A boy from a second-hand clothing store,
entered with a large bundle.</p>

<p>"I wants to know as how if the woman that was burnt out
is here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And a little boy and gal?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is the place then. Are you the gal what was at the
fire and said, 'come with us?'"</p>

<p>"Yes, why do you ask that?"</p>

<p>"'Cause the gentleman told me to ask, and when I was
sure I was right, to give the gal these three gold pieces, one
for each word, and the bundle of clothes and the letter to the
woman. That's all. So here they are. I am sure I is right
for you don't look as though you could tell a lie if you tried.
Why what ails the gal? I'll be blamed if I see anything to
cry about. Why, hang me, what does it mean? I feel just so
I should cry too if I stayed in this house long. So good bye.
I am sure it is all right?"</p>

<p>And the door closed behind him, and he was gone. What
could it mean? Was she dreaming? No! There lay the
bundle, there glistened the half eagles in her hand. It could
not be a dream, yet it was a mystery. How could any one
know so soon that her roof contained one so needy? Who
had heard those words, those three little words, every one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
which had turned to gold? Yes, and will yet turn to fruit more
precious.</p>

<p>How she wished she had asked the boy who it was, who
had been so suddenly raised up, so mysteriously sent to visit
the widow in her affliction. Perhaps the letter would tell.
So she took it and the bundle up stairs and opened both.
One contained full suits for the mother, daughter, and little
boy, all black&mdash;the other was a letter to Mr. Pease.</p>

<p>"Can this be the work of man?" said Mrs. Eaton; "who
knew, who could know, that I must wear the widow's weeds,
so soon?"</p>

<p>"There is a spirit of intelligence which maketh known
secret things. How could any one without such spiritual aid
know that you was a widow, that you was destitute, that we
had bid you come with us, that I was just going out to buy
clothes, and here they come like manna in the wilderness to
Israel's host. Who will deny spiritual influence and special interposition
now?"</p>

<p>Who will believe it, when they are told how all this seeming
mystery will melt away with the shades of the night
which brought it into the minds of these simple people?</p>

<p>"But what is in the letter, my child, does that tell anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, father; it is addressed to the Rev. Mr. Pease, at
the Five Points House of Industry, requesting him to give a
home to a poor woman and two children, and says the writer
will see him about it soon."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is just where I intended to take them, after the
funeral."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and see how nicely these clothes fit them, just as
well as though made on purpose. How could anybody guess
so well?"</p>

<p>"It is no guess work. There is something more than guess
work about this."</p>

<p>So there was.</p>

<p>"Breakfast is ready, father."</p>

<p>"Then let us eat it in thankfulness and then."</p>

<p>And then!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="h3">LITTLE KATY.&mdash;A MIDNIGHT INTERVIEW.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is said in this, will apply to everything similar.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Here's your nice Hot Corn, smoking hot, smoking hot,
just from the pot!" Hour after hour one evening, as I sat
over the desk, this cry came up in a soft, plaintive voice,
under my window, which told me of one of the ways of the
poor to eke out means of subsistence in this over-burdened,
ill-fed, and worse-lodged home of misery&mdash;of so many without
means, who are constantly crowding into the dirtiest purlieus
of this notoriously dirty city, where they are exposed to the
daily chance of death from some sudden outbreaking epidemic
like that now desolating the same kind of streets in
New Orleans, and swallowing up its thousands of victims
from the same class of poverty-stricken, uncomfortably-provided
for human beings, who know not how, or have not the
power, to flee to the healthy hills and green fields of the
country. Here they live&mdash;barely live&mdash;in holes almost as
hot as the hot corn, the cry of which rung in my ears from
dark till midnight.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This chapter was published under the simple title of "Hot Corn,"
among the "City Items" of the New York Daily Tribune, August 5,
1853. It is but slightly altered from the original text.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/page_053.jpg" width="449" height="578" alt="&quot;HOT CORN! HERE&#39;S YOUR NICE HOT CORN!&quot;" title="">
<span class="caption">&quot;HOT CORN! HERE&#39;S YOUR NICE HOT CORN!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Hot corn! hot corn! here's your nice hot corn," rose up
in a faint, child like voice, which seemed to have been
aroused by the sound of my step as I was about entering the
Park, while the city clock told the hour when ghosts go forth
upon their midnight rambles. I started, as though a spirit
had given me a rap, for the sound seemed to come out of one
of the iron posts which stand as sentinels over the main
entrance, forbidding all vehicles to enter, unless the driver
takes the trouble to pull up and tumble out of the way one
of the aforesaid posts, which is not often done, because one
of them, often, if not always, is out of its place, giving free
ingress to the court-yard, or livery stable grounds of the City
Hall, which, in consideration of the growth of a few miserable
dusty brown trees and doubtful colored grass-patches, we
call "the Park."</p>

<p>Looking over the post I discovered the owner of the hot
corn cry, in the person of an emaciated little girl about
twelve years old, whose dirty shawl was nearly the color of
the rusty iron, and whose face, hands, and feet, naturally white
and delicate, were grimmed with dirt until nearly of the
same color. There were two white streaks running down
from the soft blue eyes, that told of the hot scalding tears
that were coursing their way over that naturally beautiful
face.</p>

<p>"Some corn, sir," lisped the little sufferer, as she saw I had
stopped to look at her, hardly daring to speak to one who did
not address her in rough tones of command, such as "give
me some corn, you little wolf's whelp," or a name still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
opprobrious both to herself and mother. Seeing I had no
look of contempt for her, she said, piteously, "please buy
some corn, sir."</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I do not wish any; it is not very healthy
in such warm weather as this, and especially so late at night."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, then, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Why, go home. It is past midnight, and such little girls
as you ought not to be in the streets of this bad city at this
time of night."</p>

<p>"I can't go home&mdash;and I am so tired and sleepy. Oh dear!"</p>

<p>"Cannot go home. Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, my mother will whip me if I go home without
selling all my corn. Oh, sir, do buy one ear, and then I
shall have only two left, and I am sure she might let little Sis
and me eat them, for I have not had anything to eat since
morning, only one apple the man gave me, and part of
one he threw away. I could have stole a turnip at the
grocery when I went to get&mdash;to get something in the pitcher
for mother, but I dared not. I did use to steal, but Mr. Pease
says it is naughty to steal, and I don't want to be naughty,
indeed I don't; and I don't want to be a bad girl, like Lizzy
Smith, and she is only two years older than me, if she does
dress fine; 'cause Mr. Pease says she will be just like old
drunken Kate, one of these days. Oh dear! now there goes
a man, and I did not cry hot corn, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Do! There, that is what you shall do," as I dashed the
corn in the gutter. "Go home; tell your mother you have
sold it all, and here is the money."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wont that be a lie, sir? Mr. Pease says we must not
tell lies."</p>

<p>"No, my dear, that wont be a lie, because I have bought
it and thrown it away, instead of eating it."</p>

<p>"But, sir, may I eat it then, if you don't want it?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not good for you; good bread is better, and here
is a sixpence to buy a loaf, and here is another to buy some
nice cakes for you. Now that is your money; don't give it
to your mother, and don't stay out so late again. Go home
earlier and tell your mother you cannot sell all your corn and
you cannot keep awake, and if she is a good mother she won't
whip you."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, she is a good mother sometimes. But I am sure
the grocery man at the corner is not a good man, or he would
not sell my mother rum, when he knows&mdash;for Mr. Pease told
him so&mdash;that we poor children are starving. Oh, I wish all
the men were good men like him, and then my mother would
not drink that nasty liquor, and beat and starve us, 'cause
there would be nobody to sell her any&mdash;and then we should
have plenty to eat."</p>

<p>Away she ran down the street towards that reeking centre
of filth, poverty and misery, the noted Five Points of New,
York.</p>

<p>As I plodded up Broadway, looking in here and there upon
the palatial splendors of metropolitan "saloons"&mdash;I think that
is the word for fashionable upper class grog-shops&mdash;I almost
involuntarily cried, "hot corn," as I saw the hot spirit of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>grain, under the various guises of "pure gin"&mdash;"old rum"&mdash;"pale brandy"&mdash;"pure port"&mdash;"Heidsick"&mdash;or
"Lager-bier"&mdash;poured
down the throats of men&mdash;and ah! yes, of
women, too, whose daughters may some day sit, at midnight,
upon the cold curbstone, crying "Hot corn," to gain a penny
for the purchase of a drink of the fiery dragon they are now
inviting to a home in their bosoms, whose cry in after years
will be, "Give, give, give," and still as unsatisfied as the
horse-leech's daughters.</p>

<p>Again, as I passed on up that street, still busy and thronged
at midnight, as a country village at mid-day intermission of
church service, ever and anon, from some side-street, came up
the cry of "Hot corn&mdash;hot corn!" and ever as I heard it, and
ever as I shall, through all years to come, I thought of that
little girl and her drunken mother, and the "bad man" at
the corner grocery, and that her's was the best, the strongest
Maine Law argument which had ever fallen upon my listening
ear.</p>

<p>Again, as I turned the corner of Spring street, the glare and
splendor of a thousand gas lights, and the glittering cut glass
of that, for the first time lighted-up, bar-room of the Prescott
House&mdash;so lauded by the press for its magnificence&mdash;dashes
our eyes and blinds our senses, till we are almost ready to
agree, that first class hotels must have such Five Point denizen-making
appurtenances, as this glittering room, shamelessly,
invitingly open to the street; when that watch-word cry, like
the pibroch's startling peal, came up from the near vicinity,
wailing like a lost spirit on the midnight air&mdash;"Hot corn, hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>corn!&mdash;here's your nice hot corn&mdash;smoking hot&mdash;hot&mdash;hot
corn."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" I hear you cry&mdash;"it is a watchword&mdash;a glorious
watchword, that bids us do or die&mdash;until the smoking hot,
fiery furnace-like gates of hell, like this one now yawning
before us, shall cease to be licensed by a Christian people, or
send delicate little girls at midnight through the streets, crying
'Hot corn,' to support a drunken mother, whose first
glass was taken in a 'fashionable saloon,' or first-class liquor-selling
hotel."</p>

<p>"Hot corn," then, be the watchword of all who would rather
see the grain fed to the drunkard's wife and children, than
into the insatiable hot maw of the whiskey still.</p>

<p>Let your resolutions grow hot and strong, every time you
hear this midnight city cry, that you will devote, if nothing
more,</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="h3">WILD MAGGIE.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is human nature to scorn many things which would content
us&mdash;which do content us after we once taste them.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why the vicious scorn those who would
make them better; why they scorn to change their present
wretched life, or miserable habitations, is because they know
not what would best content them.</p>

<p>When that missionary first located his mission to the
poorest of New York city poor, the drunkards, thieves, and
prostitutes of the Five Points, he was scorned by those he
came to save. He and his mission were hated with all the
bitter hate which the evil mind oft feels for the good, made
still more bitter by the sectarian venom of ignorant Catholics
towards the hated heretic Protestants. Every annoyance that
low cunning could invent was thrown in his way.</p>

<p>Feeling the inefficiency of the system so long and so uselessly
practiced, of giving Bibles or tracts to such people, to
be sold or pawned for a tenth part of their value, he began a
new system. This was to give employment to the idle, to
teach all, who would learn, how to work, how to earn their
own living, and that industry would bring more content than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
drunkenness and its concomitant vices. Though stolen fruit
may be sweet, the bread of toil is sweeter, and he would teach
them how to gain it.</p>

<p>One of the first efforts made was work for the needle;
because that was the most easily started, can be carried on
with less capital, and, on the other hand, produces the least
capital&mdash;or rather poorest pay to those who labor. Yet it is
better than idleness, and he soon found willing hands to work,
after he opened his shop, and invited all who would conform
to the rules, and were willing to earn their bread, rather than
beg or steal it, to come and get work&mdash;such as coarse shirts
and pants&mdash;work that they could do, many of them with skill
and great rapidity, but such as they could not get trusted with
at any common establishment&mdash;the very name of the place
where they lived being sufficient to discredit them&mdash;so that
security, which they could not give, for the return of the garments,
closed the door against their very will to work.</p>

<p>Another discouraging thing against the very poor who did
occasionally get "slop shop work," arose from some gross,
cruel, wicked, downright robbery, perpetrated upon "sewing
women" by some incarnate fiend in the clothing trade. The
difficulty to get work, the miserably poor pay offered to those
who</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></div></div>

<p>is enough to sink stouter hearts than those which beat in
misery's bosom.</p>

<p>Sunk in misery, poverty, crime, filth, degradation, want;
neglected by all the world; hated by those who should love;
trodden down by those who should, if they did a Christian
duty, lift up; living in habitations such as&mdash;but no matter,
you shall go with me, by and by, to see where they live&mdash;how
could they lift themselves up, how could they be industrious
and improve their condition, how could they accept
bibles and tracts, with any promise of good?</p>

<p>So thought the missionary; and so he set himself about
giving them the means to labor, with a hope and sure promise
of reward.</p>

<p>Some of those who sent him there to preach salvation to
the heathen of the Five Points differed with him&mdash;differ still&mdash;thinking
that a Christian minister degrades himself when he
goes into a "slop shop" to give out needle-work to misery's
household&mdash;or attempts to teach industry to idle, vicious children,
or reform degraded women, by teaching them the ways
of living without sin, without selling their bodies to buy bread,
or in their despair, to exchange the last loaf for rum.</p>

<p>So he opened a shop&mdash;now enlarged into a "House of
Industry"&mdash;and soon found his reward. But he was annoyed,
hated, persecuted, beaten&mdash;but God and a good will conquered.</p>

<p>Among other petty, vexatious trifles&mdash;it is trifles that annoy&mdash;a
little girl, in rags and filth, with a mat of soft "bonny
brown hair," no doubt well colonized, bare-headed and bare-footed,
in cold or heat, used to come every day to the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ringing her shrill musical voice through the open way, through
the crack or key-hole, if it was shut, calling him all sorts of
opprobrious names, mixed with all sorts of sentences of Catholic
hatred to Protestantism, that showed that she was herself
a missionary from adults of evil minds. Then she would call
over the names of the inmates, with all their catalogue of
crimes, giving little scraps of their history, and their hateful
nick-names&mdash;singing some of the songs they used to sing in
their drunken debauches at Pete Williams's; and such a voice
as she had would have won her worshippers in high life, and
she had been with them and of them. And her features and
blue eyes were as beautiful as her voice was strong and sweet;
and there she would tell him, and the crowd of idlers who
came to listen, and laugh, and shout at her cunning tricks
and evident annoyances, for what purpose he wanted all them
old &mdash;&mdash;'s; and so it went on, day after day. All attempts
to get rid of her were of no avail. Scolding, threatening,
were alike unheeded. "Catch me first," was her answer.
Then he followed her to her home, to expostulate with her
parents. Vain effort!</p>

<p>Up Anthony street to Centre; come with me, reader, let us
look at that home!</p>

<p>There is a row of dens all along upon the east side of that
street, full of those whom hope has forsaken, and misery has
in her household. Above ground, below ground, in cellar or
garret, back room or front, black and white, see how they
swarm at door and window, in hall and stairway, and out upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the sidewalk, all day in idleness, all night in mischief, crime,
and sin.</p>

<p>Elbow your way along among the standing, and step over
the prostrate drunken or sleeping women and children along
the side-walk. Stop here&mdash;here is a sort of hole-in-the-ground
entrance to a long, dark, narrow alley, let us enter. "No,
no, not there," you will exclaim. "Surely human beings
cannot live there?"</p>

<p>Yes, they do. That girl has just gone down there, and we
will follow.</p>

<p>"Better not go there," says a young urchin in the crowd;
"a man was stabbed down there last night."</p>

<p>Encouraging; but we enter, and grope along about a hundred
feet, and a door opens on the right, the girl we have
followed darts out, up like a cat, over a high fence, on to a
roof, up that, into a garret window, with a wild laugh and
ringing words, "You didn't do it this time, you old Protestant
thief, did you? You want to catch me, to send me to
'the Island.' I know you, you old missionary villain you.
I heard Father Phelan tell what you want to do with the
poor folks at the Points; you want to turn them out of house
and home, and build up your grand houses, and make them
all go to hear you preach your lies; you do, you old heretic,
but you didn't catch me. I'll plague you again to-morrow."</p>

<p>We entered her home&mdash;the home that the missionary was
trying to turn her out of. Can it be possible that human
nature can cling to such a home, and refuse to be turned out,
or occupy a better one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The room is one of a "row," along the narrow dark corridor
we entered, half sunken below the ground, with another
just such another row overhead, each ten or twelve feet square,
with a door and one little window upon this narrow alley
which is the only yard; at the end of which there is a contagion-breeding
temple of Cloacina, common to all.</p>

<p>In "the house" that we enter, a man lies helplessly drunk
upon a dirty rug on the floor; a woman, too much overcome
to rise, sits propped up in one corner. There is altogether,
perhaps, fifty cents worth of furniture and clothing in the
room.</p>

<p>And this is the loved home of one of the smartest, brightest,
most intelligent little girls in this God-forsaken neighborhood.</p>

<p>The missionary made known his errand and was told that
he might do anything he pleased with the girl, if he would
catch her and tame her.</p>

<p>"For," said her mother, "what do we want with her at home&mdash;<i>at
home</i>!&mdash;She is never here, only to sleep."</p>

<p>Only to sleep! Where did she sleep? On the damp,
bare floor, of course, where else could she sleep in that home?</p>

<p>The next morning various devices were contrived to catch
her, to force her into a better home. All failed.</p>

<p>When did force ever succeed with one of her sex?</p>

<p>If the serpent had <i>bid</i> our first mother to eat the apple, she
would have thrown it down the villain's throat, splitting his
forked tongue in its passage.</p>

<p>Finally it was arranged that a boy, noted as "a runner,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
should stand behind the door, and when she came with her
jibes, sometimes provoking mirth, and sometimes ire, he
should jump out and catch her.</p>

<p>"Catch me if you can!" and away went she, away went he,
under this cart and over that. Now he will have her&mdash;his
hand is outstretched to seize his chase&mdash;vain hope&mdash;she drops
suddenly in his path, and he goes headlong down a cellar.
When he came up there was a great shout, and a great many
dirty bare-footed girls about, but that one was nowhere in
sight. So back he goes, enters the door; and a wild laugh
follows him close upon his heels.</p>

<p>"You didn't catch me this time, did you? Don't you want
another race? Ha, ha, ha."</p>

<p>And away she went, singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Up, up, and away with the rising sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chase is now before ye;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Up, up and away with hound and gun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The chase is now before ye."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a chase that cunning must catch, strength could not
win. Everybody said she never could be caught and tamed.
She had run wild all her young years. She was not by nature
vicious, but she was most incorrigibly mischievous. She
was, so everybody said, and he ought to know, beyond the
hope of redemption. Yet everybody was mistaken. Reader,
you already know this girl, for this is "Wild Maggie, of the
Five Points." This is the kind, sweet, tender-hearted Margaret,
you have read of in a former chapter, ministering to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wants of that poor widow and destitute children, living in
comfort, with neatness and industry, and her father, in a happy
home; and that father the poor, miserable, wretched, besotted
drunkard, whom we found in that wretched hole, in that
dark alley in Centre street.</p>

<p>What a change!</p>

<p>It was a change for good. It was a deed of mercy to
redeem such a child as this from a course of life that has but
one phase&mdash;one worse than useless object&mdash;one wretched termination.</p>

<p>What magic power had wrought this change?</p>

<p>Words of kindness, charity, hope, teachings of the happiness
attendant on virtue, religion, industry; by these the worst
can be redeemed.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>"Finding every effort unavailing," said the missionary,
"I changed my tactics. I was busy one morning in the workshop,
laying out work, when I cast my eye towards the open
door, and there saw Wild Maggie, waiting for a word upon
which she might retort. Without seeming to notice her, I
said, loud enough for her to hear, 'Oh, how I wish I had
some one to help me lay out this work.' There was a look
of intelligence spreading over her face, which seemed to say
as plainly as looks could say, 'I could do that.'</p>

<p>"'Will you?' I said; she started as though I was mentally
replying to her passing thoughts.</p>

<p>"She did not say, 'Yes,' but she thought it. I had
touched a chord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Maggie,' said I, with all the tone and looks of kindness
I could command, 'Maggie, my girl, come in; you can help
me; I know you are smart, come, I will give you sixpence if
you will help me a little while.' She stepped into the door,
looked behind it suspiciously, and started back. She remembered
the trap. 'No, I won't. You want to catch me and
send me to the Island. I know you, you old Protestant.
Old Kate told me yesterday, that you had sent off Liz. Smith,
Nance Hastings, and hump-backed Lize, and a lot of girls.'</p>

<p>"'So I have, but not to the Island. They have all got
good places where they are contented and happy. But I
don't send anybody away that don't want to go. I won't
send you away, nor won't keep you if you don't want to
stay.'</p>

<p>"'Will you let me come out again, if I come in, when I
am a mind to?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, certainly, my dear child.'</p>

<p>"My dear child!" Where has she ever heard those words?
In former days, before her father and mother had sunk so
low, as they now are, when she used to go to school, to
church, and sabbath-school, and wear clothes, such as she
was not ashamed of. Want of clothing will sink the highest
to the lowest state of rags, and dirt, and misery.</p>

<p>"'Will you swear, that you will let me come out, and you
won't beat me. Limping Bill and one-eyed Luce, his woman,
says, you licked little Sappy till she died.'</p>

<p>"'They are great liars.'</p>

<p>"'So they say you are. That you preach nothing but lies.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Well, I won't lie to you, Maggie, and I won't whip you,
but I won't swear. Did you ever know any good man
swear?'</p>

<p>"She thought a moment, and replied, 'Well, I don't know&mdash;I
know them that swear the most will lie. Will you let
the door stand open? If you will I will come in?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' and in she came.</p>

<p>"'Now, what do you want I should do?'</p>

<p>"'There, do you look at me. I am laying out shirts for
the women to sew. That pile, there, that is the body; this,
the sleeves; that, the collar; these, the wristbands; these,
the gussets; here are six buttons, and here is the thread to
make it, and then it will be a shirt when made. Now we
roll it up and tie a string around it; now it is ready to give
out. Now, you can do that just as well as I can, and you
don't know how much it will help me.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I can, and I can beat you.'</p>

<p>So she could. She was just as quick at work as she was
at play and mischief, and the piles disappeared under her
nimble fingers much more rapidly than they did under his,
and so he told her. Who had ever praised her work before,
though all had "her deviltry?"</p>

<p>The spirit of reformation had already commenced its
glorious work.</p>

<p>"When that job was finished, she turned her sweet blue
eyes upon me, with an expression which said as plain as eyes
can speak, 'I am sorry that job is done. I like that, can't you
give me another?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was no other which she could do just then, but she
said, 'What shall I do now?'"</p>

<p>"Well, Maggie, I have no more work for you to-day, but
here is your sixpence, I promised you, and here are some
cakes; come again to-morrow, you can help me every day.
I like your help."</p>

<p>She did not want to go. She had tasted of a fruit which
had opened her eyes, and she would fain clothe herself in fig
leaves, so they hid the deformity of dirt, and rags, and sin.
Wild as the fawn, as easily as the fawn subdued. At the
approach of man, that timid animal bounds into the thickest
brake and hides away; but once in the hands of man, it turns
and follows him to his home, licking his hand as though it
were with its own dam. So was Wild Maggie tamed.</p>

<p>"What shall I do now?"</p>

<p>What should she do? A score of little girls were huddling
around the door, for the news was out that Maggie, Wild
Maggie, had been caught and caged, and they wanted to see
"what would come of it."</p>

<p>"A thought struck me," said the missionary. "I asked her
if she could read. Yes, and write. Had she been to school?
Yes. Then you shall play school. You shall have these
benches, and you shall call in those children, and you shall be
the teacher, and so you may play school."</p>

<p>Was there ever a happier thought engendered. Maggie
was delighted, the children came rushing in, ready for "a
play never before enacted in this theatre."</p>

<p>For an hour or more she plied her task diligently, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
it was astonishing with what effect. How she reduced her
unruly materials to order. How she made them say, yes,
ma'am, and no, ma'am, to their school mistress. How she
made them sit and "look like somebody." Taught this one
his A B Cs, and that one to spell B-a-k-e-r. How she told
this one to wash his face, next time he came to school, and
that one if she had any better clothes, to wear them. Poor
Maggie, she never thought of the poverty of her own.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, "every one of you sit still; not a word
of noise, and no running out while I am gone, or I shall
punish you worse than shutting you up in a dark closet. Mr.
Pease, will you look to my school a moment?"</p>

<p>Away she bounded. Oh, what a step! Step! it was more
like flying. A moment, hardly time for a few pleasant words
to her school, and she bounds in again, with a little paper
parcel in her hand. What could it mean? It means that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many a flower in wilds unseen,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetest fragrance grows;<br></span>
<span class="i0">From many a deep and hidden spring,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The coolest water flows.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>She first inquires, "have they all been good?" "Yes, all."
Then she unwraps her parcel. How they look and wonder,
"what is it?"</p>

<p>What is it? Simply this.</p>

<p>She has been out and spent her sixpence to do unto others
just as she had been done unto. Did ever cakes taste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>sweeter? Did ever benevolence better enjoy herself than
Maggie did, while thus distributing her rewards? What a
lesson of self-sacrifice! The first sixpence&mdash;the whole treasure
of this world's goods, spent to promote the happiness of
others. This was a hint. It were a dull intellect that could
not improve it. The children were further fed, and bid to
come again to-morrow. "And this," said he, "was the
beginning of our ragged beggar children school, that has
proved such a blessing to this neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Maggie," said I, taking her by the hand and looking her
in the eye. "Maggie, you have helped me a great deal to-day,
will you come again to-morrow?"</p>

<p>The string was touched, and tears flowed. When had
tears, except tears of anger, filled those eyes before? What
had touched that string? Kind words!</p>

<p>"If you will let me stay, I wont go away. I can learn
to sew. I can make these shirts."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; and if you are here, these children will come,
and we will have school every day."</p>

<p>And so Wild Maggie was Wild Maggie no more. She
was tamed. Her life had taken on a new phase. To the
questions, what would her father say? what would her mother
say? she replied, "What do they care? what have they ever
cared? Though they were not always so bad as they now
are."</p>

<p>No, they were not always so bad as they now are. None
of his class were always so bad as they now are. Once her
father was James Reagan, a respectable man, a good carpenter,
and had a good home. Now where was he. Sunk, step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by step, from hotel to saloon, from saloon to bar-room, from
bar-room to corner grocery, from grocery to cellar rum hole,
from a good house to a filthy, underground den in Centre
street. He has but one more step to take&mdash;one more underground
hole to occupy.</p>

<p>But such as he may reform. He did. You have seen that.
Will you ask, how? You shall know.</p>

<p>Maggie became one of the household. She was washed,
and fed, and clothed; and how she worked, and learnt everything,
and how she listened at the temperance meetings to
what "the pledge" had done, and how she wished her mother
would come and try&mdash;try to leave off drinking, and become
"the good mother she was when I was a little girl." For her
father she had no hope. For her mother, she determined to
persevere. When she was sober she would talk, and cry, and
promise, but the demon rum would overcome her, and then
she would curse her daughter, and call her all the vile names
that the insane devil in her could invent.</p>

<p>And so it went on; Maggie still determined, still trying.
The right time came at last. One night, Maggie was not at
the meeting. By and by, there was a little stir at the door.
What is the matter? A little girl is pulling a woman, almost
by force, into the room. It is Maggie and her mother. She
has got her old ragged dress off, and looks quite neat in one
that Maggie has made for her. But she hides her face. She
is ashamed to look those in the face she would have once
looked down upon. A woman is speaking&mdash;women can speak
upon temperance&mdash;just such a woman as herself&mdash;is it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
herself&mdash;is she awake, or does she sleep and dream? If
awake, she hears her own story. The story of a woman with
a drunken husband. And she traces his fall from affluence
down to beggary; then her fall, down, down, down, to a
cellar in Farlow's Court; there her husband dies; there upon
a pile of straw and rags upon the floor, in drunken unconsciousness,
she gives birth to a child&mdash;a living child by the
side of its dead father.</p>

<p>"What a night&mdash;what a scene, but you have not seen the
worst of it. The very heavens, as though angry at such
awful use of the gifts of reason, and the abuse of appetite, sent
their forked messengers of fire to the earth&mdash;less dangerous
than the fire that man bottles up for his own damnation; and
the water came down in torrents, pouring into that cave where
the dead, and living, and new born were lying together, and
overflowed the floor, and when I felt its chill," said she, "I
awaked out of my drunken sleep, and felt around me, to see,
no, I could not see, all was pitch darkness. My child cried,
and then&mdash;then a whole army of rats, driven in by the rain,
driven by the water from the floor, came creeping on to me.
Oh! how their slimy bodies felt as they crept over my face.
Then I tried to awaken my husband, but he would not wake,
and in my frenzy I struck and bit him&mdash;bit a dead man&mdash;for
his was the sleep of eternity. Then I summoned almost superhuman
strength, and creeped up the stairs and out into the
court. I looked up; the storm was gone; there was a smile
in heaven&mdash;it was the smile of that murdered babe; for when
I had begged a light, and went back again to that dreadful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
dreadful habitation&mdash;why are human beings permitted to live
in such awful holes&mdash;has nobody any care for human life&mdash;what
did I see? Mothers, mothers&mdash;mothers that sleep on
soft couches&mdash;hear me, hear me&mdash;hear of the bitter fruits
the rum trade bears&mdash;the rats had devoured the life blood of
that child. What next I know not. I know that I have
never drank since&mdash;never will again&mdash;by signing this pledge
I was saved&mdash;all may be saved."</p>

<p>"All? all? Can I&mdash;can I be restored as you have been&mdash;can
I shake off this demon that has dragged me down so low
that my own mother would not know me; or knowing, would
spurn me? Can I be saved?"</p>

<p>It was Maggie's mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, you, you, I was a thousand times worse. Look at me
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, you. Come." And she took her by the
hand and led her up to the table, put a pen in her hand&mdash;dropt
upon her knees&mdash;looked up to her mother imploringly&mdash;up
to heaven prayerfully&mdash;her lips quivered&mdash;the tears rolled
down her cheeks&mdash;"Now, mother, now."</p>

<p>'Tis done. She wrote her name in a fair hand&mdash;Mary Reagan&mdash;'Tis
done.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis done!&mdash;'tis done!&mdash;wild Maggie cries;<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis done!&mdash;'tis done!&mdash;the mother sighs;<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis done!&mdash;'tis done!&mdash;in chorus join,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bear aloft the news along.<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis done!&mdash;'tis done! a voice replies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stand forth, be strong, and you shall rise.<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And so she did. She never fell. She came to live in the
house with Maggie. "I cannot go back," she said, "to live with
your father, if I would stand fast; and I cannot think, after
hearing that woman's story, last night, of ever drinking again.
I know that woman; I knew her when she was a girl, one of
the proudest and prettiest. My husband has spent many a
dollar with hers in the bar-room. Oh yes, I knew her well.
I did not know her last night; but when she told me who she
was&mdash;that she was Elsie Wendall&mdash;then I knew her. Oh! I
could tell you such a story&mdash;but not now. No! no, I cannot
live with your father again, for I never will drink any more&mdash;never&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"But what, if father will take the pledge?"</p>

<p>"Oh! then I should be a happy woman again. But there
is no hope."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is hope. I shall watch him; and, mother, I
<i>will</i> save him."</p>

<p>It was a great promise&mdash;a great undertaking for a young
girl to promise with an "I will." When did "I will" in
woman's mouth ever fail?</p>

<p>That will was the strength of her life. It was for that she
now lived and labored. Now she had hope&mdash;now 'twas lost&mdash;now
revived again. Now he worked a month&mdash;sober for a
whole month&mdash;then down he went if he happened to go into
one of his old haunts, or meet with some of his old companions,
who said, "come, Jim, let's take one drink&mdash;only one&mdash;one
won't do any hurt"&mdash;but two follow the one. Then Maggie
would look him up, get him sober again, and get him to work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>God bless that child! God did bless her, for she stuck to
him, until he finally consented to come once, just once to the
temperance meeting&mdash;but he would not sign the pledge&mdash;he
never would sign away his liberties&mdash;no&mdash;he was a free man.
Well only come, come and listen&mdash;come and see mother.
That touched him. He loved mother&mdash;Yes he would come.
The evening came. Maggie watched every shadow that
darkened the door. Finally the last one seemed to have entered,
but Jim Reagan was not among them. Maggie could
not give it up. She slipped out into the street, it was well
she did. She was just in time. A knot of men were talking
together, of the tyranny of temperance men, wanting to make
slaves of the people, getting them to sign away their rights&mdash;rights
their fathers fought and bled for.</p>

<p>Yes, and so had they&mdash;at the nose.</p>

<p>They had just carried the point, and started to follow Cale
Jones over to his grocery, who was going to stand treat all
round. One lingered a moment&mdash;looked back&mdash;as though he
had promised to go that way&mdash;but appetite was too strong for
conscience, and he turned towards the rum-hole. Just then a
gentle hand is laid upon his arm, and a sweet voice says:</p>

<p>"Father, come with me, come and see mother&mdash;don't go
with those men."</p>

<p>Woman conquered.</p>

<p>When Cale Jones counted noses, to see which he should
charge with the treat he had promised "to stand," he found
Jim Reagan was not in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Why, damn the fellow, he has given us the slip after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
our trouble. I thought we had made a sure thing of it. I
tell you what it is, boys, we must manage somehow to stop
this business, or trade is ruined. If people are not to be
allowed to drink anything but water, there'll be many an
honest man out of business. Times is hard enough now,
what'll they be then?"</p>

<p>Just then Tom Nolan, the mason&mdash;it used to be Drunken
Tom Nolan&mdash;was telling what they would be, at the temperance
meeting.</p>

<p>It was a propitious time for Maggie. She led her father
in, he hung back a little, and tried to get into a dark corner
near the door. That she would not allow; some of Satan's
imps might drag him away from the very threshold of salvation.
She led him along, he was sober now, and looked sad,
perhaps, ashamed.</p>

<p>"James, you here? Oh!"</p>

<p>It was his wife. He knew her voice, it was that of other
days. He stared at her; could it be her, so neat, and clean,
and well dressed, and speaking so fondly to him&mdash;to him&mdash;for
she had refused to see him ever since she took the
pledge. Now, she came forward, took him by the hand,
ragged and dirty as he was&mdash;she knew what would clean
him&mdash;led him to a seat and sat down by his side. Maggie
sat on the other. For a minute the speaker could not go on.
There was a choking in his throat, strong man as he was, and
there were many tears in the eyes that looked upon that
father, mother, and daughter, that night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jim Reagan," said the speaker, "I am glad to see you here.
You are an old acquaintance of mine."</p>

<p>Jim Reagan looked at him with astonishment. Could that
well dressed laboring man, clean shaved and clean shirted, be
Tom Nolan?</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that you look inquiringly at me, as much
as to say, 'is that you?' Yes, it is me, Tom Nolan, the
mason, me who used to lay around the dirty rum holes with
you, begging, lying, stealing, to get a drink. Do you think
that now I would pick up old cigar stumps and quids of
tobacco, to fill my pipe? Do you think I would wear a hat,
as I have done, that my poor beggared boy picked out of the
street? Look at that. Does that look like the old battered
thing I used to wear? Do these clothes look like the dirty
rags I wore when you and I slept in Cale Jones's coal-box?
Do I look like the drunken Tom Nolan that kept a family of
starving beggars, with two other families, in one room, ten by
twelve feet square; and that a garret room, without fireplace,
without glass in its one window; with the roof so low that I
could only stand up straight in one corner; and that mean
room in the vilest locality on earth, in a house&mdash;ah! whole
row of houses, tenanted by just such miserable, rum-beggared
human beings&mdash;buildings owned by a human monster&mdash;houses
for the poor which are enough to sicken the vilest of
beasts; such as no good man would let for tenements, even
when he could get tenants as degraded as I was&mdash;tenements
that any Christian grand jury would indict, and any court,
which desired to protect the lives of the people, would compel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the owners to pull down, as the worst, with one exception, of
all city nuisances.</p>

<p>"How did I live there? How did my wife and children
ever live there, in that little miserable room, with seven
others, just such wretches as ourselves? How do hundreds
of such men, women, and children as we were, still live there?
I was in that same room&mdash;the place my children used to call
<i>home</i>&mdash;this evening. The entrance is in Cow Bay. If you
would like to see it, saturate your handkerchief with camphor,
so that you can endure the horrid stench, and enter. Grope
your way through the long, dark, narrow passage&mdash;turn to
your right, up the dark and dangerous stairway; be careful
where you place your foot around the lower step, or in the
corners of the broad stairs, for it is more than shoe-mouth
deep of steaming filth. Be careful too, or you may meet
some one&mdash;perhaps a man, perhaps a woman&mdash;as nature
divides the sexes; as the rum seller combines them, both
beasts, who in their drunken frenzy may thrust you, for the
very hatred of your better clothes, or the fear that you have
come to rescue them from their crazy loved dens of death,
down, headlong down, those filthy stairs. Up, up, winding
up, five stories high, now you are under the black smoky roof;
turn to the left&mdash;take care and not upset that seething pot of
butcher's offal soup, that is cooking upon a little furnace at
the head of the stairs&mdash;open that door&mdash;go in, if you can get
in. Look; here is a negro and his wife sitting upon the floor&mdash;where
else could they sit, for there is no chair&mdash;eating their
supper off of the bottom of a pail. A broken brown earthen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
jug holds water&mdash;perhaps not all water. Another negro and
his wife occupy another corner; a third sits in the window
monopolising all the air astir. In another corner, what do
we see?</p>

<p>"A negro man, and a stout, hearty, rather good looking,
young white woman."</p>

<p>"Not sleeping together?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly that&mdash;there is no bed in the room&mdash;no
chair&mdash;no table&mdash;no nothing&mdash;but rags, and dirt, and vermin,
and degraded, rum degraded, human beings&mdash;men and women
with just such souls as animate the highest and proudest in
the land."</p>

<p>"Who is this man?"</p>

<p>"Dat am Ring-nosed Bill."</p>

<p>"Is that his wife?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that. He calls her his woman."</p>

<p>"And she lives with him as his wife&mdash;you all live here
together in this room?"</p>

<p>"Well, we is got nowhere else to live. Poor folks can't
lib as rich ones do&mdash;hab to pay rent&mdash;pretty hard to do that
alone."</p>

<p>"How much rent for this room?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-five cents a week, ebry time in advance."</p>

<p>"Who is this man?"</p>

<p>"They calls me Snaky Jo. 'Spose may be my name is Jo
Snaky. Don't know rightly."</p>

<p>"What do you do for a living?"</p>

<p>"Well, mighty hard to tell dat, dat am fact, massa. Picks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
up a job now and then. Mighty hard times though&mdash;give
poor man a lift, massa."</p>

<p>"Is that man and woman drunk."</p>

<p>"Well, 'spose am, little tossicated."</p>

<p>"A little intoxicated! They are dead drunk, lying perfectly
unconscious, in each other's <i>emesis</i>, upon the bare floor. The
atmosphere of this room is enough to breed contagion, and
sicken the whole neighborhood, and would, but that the
whole neighborhood is equally bad. Let us hasten down to
the open air of the court&mdash;it is but little better&mdash;all pollution&mdash;all
that breathe it, polluted. Yet, in that gate of death I
once lived. Look at me, James, you knew me then. Look
at me now, you don't know me. You knew me a beast&mdash;you
may know me a man&mdash;you may know yourself one.
Sign this paper&mdash;there is a power of magic in it&mdash;and you
shall go home with me, and see where I live now, and I will
clothe you and help to sustain you in your sober life, just as
Thomas Elting did me, and with heaven's blessing, we will
make a man of you."</p>

<p>"Too late! too late! not enough of the old frame left to
rebuild."</p>

<p>"It is never too late. Look at the piles of old brick, and
tiles, and boards, and joist, and rafters, and doors, and glass,
of the pulled down houses. Are they wasted? I am a
mason, you a carpenter; if we cannot put them back and
build up the same old-fashioned edifice, we can make a good,
snug, comfortable house. Come, sign the contract, and let
us set right about the job."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father, come, father!"</p>

<p>He turned and spoke a few low words to his wife, to which
she replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. Keep the pledge one month and I will go
and live with you, die with you."</p>

<p>"Then try it, father, come." And she led him forward,
just as she had done her mother. You have seen, shall see,
how heaven blessed her for filial piety.</p>

<p>"I used to write. 'Tis a long time since I did. Maggie,
my hand trembles. Help me&mdash;guide the pen. I cannot see
clearly."</p>

<p>No wonder. There was a tear in each eye. There were
other tears when Maggie took him again by the hand, and
again said:</p>

<p>"Come, father, let us pray;" and then all kneeled down
together, and then Mr. Nolan took him by the arm, and said,
"Come, James, let us go home."</p>

<p>Not yet. He had one more act to perform. He shook his
wife's hand, and said, "Good bye. I shall keep it." Then
he looked wishfully at Maggie, as though he wanted something,
yet dare not ask it, for fear he should be repulsed.
Still the yearning of nature was upon him. It was a long
time since he had felt it as he now felt, but he was beginning
to be a new man. Maggie was his only child, his once loved,
much caressed child. Would she ever cling those arms
around his neck again. She had shown herself this night
one of the blessed of this earth. She had done, or induced
him to do, what no other soul on earth could have done, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
how his heart did yearn to clasp her in his arms. He stopped
half way to the door, and looked upon her with tearful,
loving, thankful eyes. It needs no wires, no magnet, no
human contrivance, to convey the magnetism of the heart.
She felt its power, as it sprung from the lightning flash of
loving eyes, and quick as that flash, she made one bound, one
word, "Father!" and her arms were around his neck, her lips
to his, and here let us shift the scene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE TEMPTATION.&mdash;THE FALL.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eve was tempted of Satan, and fell.<br></span>
<span class="i0">So have been her children.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>About two months after the events of the last chapter, a
few of the new friends of James Reagan joined together, procured
a comfortable room in Mulberry street, and put in the
necessary articles of furniture, and his wife, faithful to her
promise, came to live with him. There was a great contrast
between this and the home where we visited him in Centre
street. Nolan and Elting stuck to him, and he stuck to the
pledge. Margaret watched him, visited him, went with him
and her mother to church and temperance meetings, and,
finally, became satisfied and happy that her father had made
a complete reformation, and that he had outlived all danger
of relapse; so she accepted a good offer to go into the country,
and live in a farmer's house, where she would learn house-work.
It was her fortune, but his misfortune, thus to be
separated. She was his ever-watchful guardian angel. His
wife was affectionately kind, and they lived together, as of old,
happily. And so, as of Adam and Eve in paradise, they
might have lived, if there had been no serpents in New York.
They beset him&mdash;waylaid him&mdash;tempted him&mdash;but no art
could induce him to enter their sulphurous dens. Cale Jones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
swore that he would get him back; that he would have him
among his old cronies again, or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>"Them ere cold water chaps aren't a going to crow over
me that ere way, no how. I tell you what it is, boys, you
must contrive some way to get Jim in here some night; he
has got money now, and if he won't drink himself, he shall
stand treat any how. We've treated him many a time."</p>

<p>"Dat am de fac," says Ring-nosed Bill.</p>

<p>"Shut your clapper, you drunken nigger, you; who axt
you to put in your oar. If you want to do anything, just get
Jim Reagan, by hook or crook, in here once more."</p>

<p>"And you will give him what you did Pedlar Jake."</p>

<p>"Shut pan, or I'll chuck your ivory into your bread-basket.
What's in your wool, Snakey?"</p>

<p>"Dis nigger knows how to fix him. Make him come his
self."</p>

<p>"Let her rip, Snakey; how'll you do it?"</p>

<p>"Jis go to work at right end foremost. 'Spose you the
debble stick him forked tongue right out all at once to frighten
Fader Adam? No, sir-ee; he creep round mighty sly, and
wiggle him tail at Mudder Eve, and den she come it over de
old man. Dat am the way. Aren't you got no gumption?"</p>

<p>"I understand. Who shall the Eve be, Snakey?"</p>

<p>"Smoky Sal. She is a pet of his. He got her in."</p>

<p>"I know it. She is in that old missionary's claws.
How are you going to get her out?"</p>

<p>"Dat easy 'nuff, so you work him right. Gib us a drink,
Cale. I isn't going to grab for you for nothing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll give you a gallon if you bring him in. How'll you
do it?'</p>

<p>"Do you think this nigger am a fool, sure? 'Spose I
gwine to tell you, and lose the gallon. Take notice, Ring-nose,
it's a fair trade. So jis you git ready to-morrow night
for business, case he'll be down then."</p>

<p>The next night the trap was set. Snakey went to One-eyed
Angeline, and promised her a share in the gallon, if she
would contrive a plan to get Smoky Sal out of the House of
Industry, and get her over to Cale Jones's, and get her drunk.</p>

<p>These two had long been sisters in sin. One had reformed,
or was trying to reform, for Reagan had got her into the
House, and seemed very anxious for her, having, as he said,
been the cause of her downfall. The other hated her for her
reformation, and would drag her back, down, down, to the
wretched life she had escaped from.</p>

<p>So she sent word to Sally that she was sick and almost
dying, and begged her to come and see her. How could she
refuse? So she went, and found her with her head tied up,
and in dreadful pain. Directly in came Snakey Jo, with the
first installment of the gallon. It was to bathe her head.
Can an old inebriate put liquor upon the outside of the head
without putting it in? Sally could not. She smelt&mdash;she
tasted&mdash;she drank&mdash;was drunk&mdash;and then Angeline took her
down to Cale Jones's grocery, and into his back room, and
then that black imp of a worse than slave's master, watched
for Reagan as he started for home, and with an air of honesty
that might deceive the wariest old fox into a trap, he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
him how "Angeline had coaxed Sally into the grocery, and
he had been watching an hour"&mdash;that was the only truth he
spoke&mdash;he watched for another victim&mdash;"and she hadn't
come out yet, and he was afraid she was in trouble; and now,
Mister Reagan, I is so glad I is fell in wid you, accidental
like, case I didn't know as you was in the Points, case you
can get her out, and get her back home."</p>

<p>With a natural impulse to do good, he determined, imprudently,
to be sure, to do what he had not done since he signed
the pledge&mdash;to enter a rum-hole. There he found the two
women as the negro had told him. Sally was completely
overcome, and lying in one corner of "the back room."
Back it was, quite out of sight or hearing of the street, where
many a victim had been robbed at a game of cards, or by
more direct means. It was in this room that Pedlar Jake
got his quietus.</p>

<p>"I had been in the room often before," said Reagan. "I
knew the way, and I paid no heed to the hypocritically angry
words I was greeted with as I entered, and told to clear out
and mind my own business. I pushed my way through the
crowd of loafers, and entered the door of death. That old
witch, Angeline, took care to get out of my way as I went in.
I sat down upon the bed and tried to rouse up the victim of
this infernal plot, little thinking that I was the greatest one
of the two. The room was very close and foul, and as I had
been unused, lately, to breathe such air, it made me sick.
'Tom,' said I&mdash;let me stop and moralize a little upon this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>name. I would never call a child, Tom. There is something
fatal in the word. I have known more drunken Toms
than of all other names. It is a low-bred name. Bill, Jim, Joe,
Sam, Ike, are all bad, but none equal to Tom." "Two of my
drunkenest companions," said Reagan, "afterwards, my best
friends, were Toms&mdash;now Thomas Elting and Thomas
Nolan." Parents, don't nickname your children, it is a step
down that may carry them to the bottom of the ladder.</p>

<p>Give your children good names; names they will not be
ashamed of in after life, and never cut them short. Never
call, William, Bill; or, Catherine, Kate; or, Mary, that most
beautiful of all names, a name I love, Moll; it will, perhaps,
be the direct cause of their ruin as they grow up. Who
would think of speaking a foul word to Miss Mary Dudley?
Who would speak with respect to Moll Dud? Parents, think
of it.</p>

<p>Now, here was another Tom. A bright, active boy&mdash;Tom
Top, whose proper name was, Thomas Topham. What if he
had been called Charles? why, his nickname would have been
an elongation to Charley, a name that everybody loves. At
any rate, he would not have been, drunken Tom&mdash;a poor,
neglected orphan boy, who, for want of some one to guide
and keep him in the path of virtue, had strayed into the
very worst of all paths of vice. From a home, where he
received a fair education, and had a good mother, but a
father who learned him to drink, and who thought it cunning
to call him, Tom Top, he was come down to be a mere
hanger-on around Cale Jones's grocery.</p>

<p>"God never works without an object," is an axiom of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
who look every day to him for counsel. We shall see in
time how the villain was defeated in his object of bringing
Reagan into this place, and making use of Tom for an instrument
of his ruin.</p>

<p>"'Tom,' said I, 'bring me a glass of water.' He did so, I
tasted it and set it down a moment for the ice to melt. When
I took it up again, I swallowed the whole tumbler full at a
gulph. In a moment my throat, my stomach, my brain were
on fire. I had drank half-a-pint of white whiskey. Those
wicked wretches had hired Tom to substitute one glass for
the other. What transpired for three days after, I know not."</p>

<p>The next morning, before sunrise, his wife came down to
the Points in an agony of fear. "Was Reagan there?" was
her hopeful inquiry. Hope sunk and almost carried her with
it when told that he left there before ten to go home. "Then
he is lost, lost, lost!"</p>

<p>All that day he was searched for up and down, high and
low, but nobody had seen him. How the villains lied, for
they were all the time gloating over their victory&mdash;double
victory&mdash;two stray sheep won back&mdash;back to the wolf's den.
All that day the pack were carousing upon the money robbed
from Reagan.</p>

<p>"What a glorious haul, boys," says Cale Jones, "we must
have Tom Elting and Nolan, next, and then hurrah, boys,
we'll break up old Pease and drive him out of the Points yet."</p>

<p>How could human nature become so infernally depraved,
as to rejoice over and glorify such deeds of darkness?</p>

<p>By Rum. The very parent of total depravity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>At night, after their day's work, Elting and Nolan came
down and joined the search, looking into every hole that was
most likely to have been used for his tomb, worse than tomb,
for it was the burial-place of his soul. They did not look in
Cale Jones's back room, for he "took his Bible oath that Jim
Reagan had never entered his door in a three month."</p>

<p>Finally, after the pack had spent every cent of his money,
and pawned every article of his clothing, they were ready to
get rid of his company. But they were not quite satisfied
with the misery they had made for his wife, and so they plotted
a scheme so wicked that the most incarnate one of all the
hosts of the infernal regions would blush to own the deed.</p>

<p>They knew that Sally had been a source of disturbance, a
cause of jealousy to his wife in by-gone years, and so they
laid their plan. Madalina, a little beggar girl, an Italian rag-picker's
daughter, was promised a sixpence to go, as she would
not be suspected, to tell Mrs. Reagan, that Tom knew where
her husband was.</p>

<p>It was a faint hope, but drowning men catch at straws.</p>

<p>Tom was hunted up. He was easily found, for he had his
instructions, "to bring the old woman along." Did they hope
in her frenzy of despair and jealousy that she too would fall?
Yes they did.</p>

<p>Could human ingenuity contrive anything more harrowing
to the mind of a wife, searching for her absent husband, than
an introduction into a room where he was in bed with another
woman, folding her, in his drunken insanity, in his arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
protesting how he loved her, loved her better than he did&mdash;better
than&mdash;his grog?</p>

<p>The monsters missed their aim. Mrs. Reagan spoke kindly
to him as though in her own bed; begged him to get up and
go home with her. No he would not. She might go back
to her old missionary paramour. She might go to &mdash;&mdash; no
matter where, he was drunk. But he could not get up, for
the villains had stripped him of every stitch of clothing; they
had not even left him a shirt. So she went away, sorrowing.</p>

<p>"Tom," said she, "come, go home with me, that is a good
boy, I feel so faint and weak." Tom was a good boy; who
had ever said it though? One, one he remembered, and these
words came like hers and nestled down in his heart. They
will live there and drive out evil ones.</p>

<p>Tom went home with her, giving her his arm and telling
her to lean upon it. Tom was not the best of guides, he
made several missteps that day, for tears dimmed his eyes,
but he made one good step, it was up the ladder of reform.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Reagan," said he, "let me stay here to-day, I have got
no home, and I don't feel as though I wanted to go back to
Cale Jones's."</p>

<p>No. He did not want to go back there. He had heard
the sound of his dead mother's voice, saying, good boy. Nobody
would say, good boy, if he went back there. Conscience
too was doing her work; conscience told him what he had
done to a woman who now said, "good boy."</p>

<p>So he stayed&mdash;he was a good boy&mdash;she was sick and he
waited upon her all day. At night he was going to get Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Elting and Nolan to go with him and bring Reagan home.
That would be his reward. He has his hand upon the door
to go out, but waits a moment to see who comes. He opens
it to a hurried footstep, and in bounds Wild Maggie, her face
radiant with health, strength, and the lovely bloom of country
life.</p>

<p>"Where's father? Mother sick? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Her mother draws the clothes over her face. She would
not have her daughter see her weep.</p>

<p>"Tom, my boy, tell me; come, Tom, that is a good boy&mdash;the
truth, nothing but the truth&mdash;I must know it."</p>

<p>Good boy, again, and his heart overflowed. He could stand
kicks, and cuffs, and curses, without a tear, but he could not
hold out against, "good boy."</p>

<p>"Maggie, I will not lie to <i>you</i>, I could not; but I can't tell
you the truth."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I am 'fraid you won't call me good boy again."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. I don't believe you are a bad one."</p>

<p>"And you won't hate me?"</p>

<p>"No, no; she cannot hate you, for you have been good to
her mother, to-day."</p>

<p>"Mother! Oh! I know all about it. You need not tell
me. Only, where is he? I will go and bring him home."</p>

<p>"Did Heaven ever give a mother such another child?"</p>

<p>Yes, many such. Many a flower would send its blossomed
sweets to many a heart, but for blighting frosts in its young
years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"What sent you home, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, mother; I felt as though I was wanted.
Something told me so. I dreamed so for three nights, and so
I came."</p>

<p>She was soon told everything. Tom made a full confession;
and still she did not hate him. She told him how he
could help her. He should go with her; she was going to
bring her father home. She gave him a little bundle of
clothes to carry; and away they went. She stopped on her
way down, at the police office, made her complaint, and took
an officer along with her, who arrested Cale Jones and the two
women; the rest of the gang were prowling for prey somewhere
else. The women were sent to the Island, next day,
for they had no friends. The plotter of villainy had. The
Alderman of the Sixth Ward, was his friend; political friend;
him he sent for; and after being an hour in custody, he was
discharged; and this was the end of his punishment.</p>

<p>Reagan, since his wife's visit in the morning, had steadily
refused to drink any more, and had become in a measure sober.
It was a sad meeting with his daughter. At first, he refused
to see or speak to her. He was ashamed. Nature overcame
him at last, and he got up and pulled off the dirty suit his
robbers had put on him, preparatory to kicking him into the
street, and put on the clean ones, which Maggie and Tom had
brought him; and then they took him, each by an arm, and
went home. It was a sad home; it never will be a happy one
again. Then she went to work and got him some supper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
spending of her own little store to buy some tea, and such
things as he could eat.</p>

<p>"Now," says she, "I have got another thing to do to-night,
for I must go back again in the morning. Tom, I am going
to provide you with a home. You must go to the House of
Industry, reform, and make a man of yourself."</p>

<p>Reader, do not forget. This ministering angel, is Wild
Maggie.</p>

<p>Most willingly he went with her, and was most kindly
received by the Superintendent. There we will leave him
awhile. We shall see him again perhaps.</p>

<p>Maggie went back to her country home. Her father
remained sick for some days, and then went to work, but his
spirit was broken, he grew more and more uneasy, and finally,
in a fit of despondency, met with one of his old cronies, and
back he went, down, down, to his former degradation. Had
he gone back and renewed his pledge, after his first fall, when
he was dragged down, he might have been saved; but he
would not; he said, he had proved himself incapable of ever
being a man again, and so he sunk in despair. Week after
week his clothes, his furniture, his wife's clothes, even her
daughter's gift-Bible, went for rum. Nothing was left, but
starvation. Yes, there was one thing left for her&mdash;one thing
that that wife had never before received from her husband.</p>

<p>A blow, a black-eye, and a kick. It was one drop too
much in her cup of affliction, and she parted with him for
ever, and came back to her old home, the House of Industry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom welcomed her with a smile; he was door-keeper
now.</p>

<p>"It is better to be door-keeper," said he, "in the house&mdash;you
know the rest. I will call Mr. P. I am sure, he will give
you a home, he said as much yesterday. I shall write to
Maggie now, and let her know all about it."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Tom, to say that."</p>

<p>"Well, wasn't she kind to me? Where should I have
been all this time, if it had not been for her? I think, we
will get the old man in again, yet."</p>

<p>"No, no, he is passed everything, now. He never was so
bad before, never struck me a blow before. A blow from
him! Oh! it is dreadful. I never can forgive that."</p>

<p>"Don't say that. 'Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.'"</p>

<p>"True, my boy, you have taught me a lesson. I will forgive,
but I don't think he will ever get over this bout; he is
very violent."</p>

<p>"The most violent fires are soonest burnt out."</p>

<p>Tom had faith, she had none, she was a sad victim of despair&mdash;a
despairing wife. But time will heal the deepest
wounds. She went to work, grew cheerful, and contented
there to spend the remainder of her life, which she said,
would not be long. Of that she seemed to have a presentiment,
and made all preparation which it becomes a reasonable
mortal to make for such a prospective journey. She
seemed to have but one wish.</p>

<p>"Oh! if I could see my husband as he was a few months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
ago, I should be willing to die then. But I cannot bear to
die now with the thought upon my mind, that he would
never shed a tear at my grave."</p>

<p>His time was coming. Tom was a philosopher. "Didn't
I tell you," says he, "that the fire would soon burn out. He
was here last night, walking up and down the pavement for
hours, looking down into the kitchen when you were at
work."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he wanted to strike me again."</p>

<p>"No, he was as sober as a judge."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! then may be he was hungry, poor man."</p>

<p>"So I thought, and went and bought him a loaf of bread.
When I gave it to him, he burst into tears, and walked away
to a cart and sat down to eat it. He was hungry, and for
fear he would be dry, and go to that cursed hole&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't swear, Tom."</p>

<p>"I can't help it; it is one, and why not call it so? I did
not want him to go there, and so I went and got him a cup
of water, and carried to him, and then I thought if everybody
knew what a blessed thing it is to give these poor old
drunkards bread and water instead of rum, how much
happiness they might make in the world. And then I talked
to him about taking the pledge again, but he said, 'no, Tom,
I took it once, I don't want to break it again.' 'No,' said I,
'you did not break it, it was me that did it, I was the guilty
one.' And then I told him all about it. He never knew
before. The rascals there told him, that he and Sally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
came there together and called for whiskey, and then got
drunk and went to bed together, and he believed it; his mind
was so confused that he forgot all about the past, and he never
knew till now that they had lied to him so shockingly. 'You
don't know,' says he, 'Tom, what a load you have lifted off
of my conscience.' Then I asked him where he was going
to sleep that night?</p>

<p>"'Where? where should I? In the cart or under it. Anywhere
I can find a hole. Me that have had a house of my
own, and built a score of houses for others to sleep in, have
not slept in one these two months. Perhaps never shall
again.'</p>

<p>"'Yes you will,' says I; 'you will sleep in that one to-night.'</p>

<p>"'What! under the same roof with my wife once more; I
don't know as I could stand it; it is more happiness than I
deserve.'</p>

<p>"'No, it is not; and if you will go away in the morning,
and stay away all day, and come back at night as sober as
you are now, I will ask the Superintendent to take you in for
good.'</p>

<p>"'I will, I will! I will go away and sweep the streets to-morrow;
they will give me another loaf of bread, and that is
more than I have had for a whole week.'</p>

<p>"So you see, he will come again to-night, and then it is
temperance meeting, and we will get him in. Depend upon
it, if he ever takes the pledge again he will never break it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>True to his word, Reagan came the next night sober.</p>

<p>"See," said he, "Tom, I have got a quarter of a dollar, and
have not spent it for liquor. If some of the harpies knew I
had it, how they would be after me."</p>

<p>He hesitated long about going into the meeting. He was
afraid his wife would be there, and he could not bear to meet
her. She was equally afraid to meet him. Finally, one of the
assistants went out and talked with him.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he replied, "that I could ever be a man
again? I am afraid there is not enough of me left to make
one. Manhood is all gone. I feel as though I had made a
beast of myself so long, that I must always be a beast. But
if you think there is enough left of the old wreck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough? Yes; come along."</p>

<p>This was a new voice, just come up on the other side. He
looked around; it was Nolan.</p>

<p>"Nolan, my old friend&mdash;you were a friend to me; and I
will try if Mr. Pease will agree to shut me up and keep me
out of the way of these alligators. Look at them. Don't they
lie about just like alligators in the mud and swamps, ready to
snap up every poor dog that comes within reach of their
tails or jaws?"</p>

<p>Well, he took the pledge, and in due time we will see how
he kept it.</p>

<p>While I give my readers a little respite from the contemplation
of such characters as have been introduced in the
preceding chapters, I propose to introduce a little episode in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the life of two of those which they have seen engaged in the
noble work of reclaiming and sustaining a poor inebriate in
his efforts to become a sober man. That they had reason to
believe in the possibility of such reclamation, the reader will
understand after reading the historical facts of the next
chapter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="h3">THE TWO PENNY MARRIAGE.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And ye twain shall be one flesh."<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>No, not even rum; yet it often does. We have just read
of one of the many thousand sad instances that have occurred
in this world, of rum separating those who had taken upon
them that holy ordinance which makes them as one flesh, one
heart, one mind; and, unless such have one mind both to be
drunk together, how can they live with one another? How
can they live in rum's pollution in the holy bonds of matrimony?
There is nothing holy about such a sinful life.</p>

<p>Do away with the cause&mdash;abolish intoxicating liquor from
society, and you will not only rivet those holy bonds with
golden rivets, but you will shut up nine-tenths of the brothels
and gaming houses in this city. Without rum they could
not live over the first quarter's rent day. With it their profits
are enormous&mdash;its effects awful.</p>

<p>I could point you to a house in this city, with its twenty-five
painted harlots, where the sales of wine in one year have
been thirteen thousand bottles, costing $15,000, and selling
for $39,000. And why not a profit, since men and women
will get drunk in a palace, the mere repairs or additions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to which, in one season, cost the almost incredible sum of
$70,000?</p>

<p>Who furnished the money? Who made the inmates what
they are? Those who <i>made the wine</i>; not those who furnished
the grape juice, for it is probable that the whole did not contain
a thousand bottles full of that liquor.</p>

<p>What caused the inmates to be what they are? Rum!</p>

<p>Who made them harlots? Not those who marry, or are
given in marriage.</p>

<p>Marriage is one of the best preventives of licentiousness,
but it is not often perhaps that it produces so positive a reformation
as in the following cases.</p>

<p>"I have married," said Mr. Pease to me one day, "some
very curious couples. That of Elting was very remarkable."</p>

<p>He was sitting one evening, trying to post up his books,
amid continued interruptions, such as, "Little Lucy's eyes are
worse to-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Let me see. She must go into the hospital. Send the
sore-eye nurse to me. Take this little girl to your room&mdash;keep
her eyes well washed with cold water, and use that
ointment. Report to me to-morrow. Go."</p>

<p>"That is a fine-looking woman."</p>

<p>"Yes, and an excellent nurse. She lived last year in one
of those Centre street cellars. She came here with both eyes
nearly out of her head; gouged by a drunken husband. We
put her into the sore eye hospital, and soon found she would
make a good nurse for the afflicted children."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Pease, is it the powder once and the pills every hour,
or is it t'other way?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. The other way. You have hit it. The powder
is Dover's Powder, to allay fever. The pills are cathartic.
Go."</p>

<p>"Cathartic. I never heard of that pill-maker before. Wonder
if he will make as many as Brandreth has," says this
interrupter as she goes away.</p>

<p>"Susan Apsley says you promised her she might go out
this evening."</p>

<p>"Did she come in all right when she was out before?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>"Let her go."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, may I go with her?"</p>

<p>"Who is this."</p>

<p>"Juliana, sir. I want to go and see my cousin Madalina,
sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember. You are the little Italian tambourine
girl. Yes, you may go. See if you can get that pretty
cousin of yours to come and live here."</p>

<p>"She would like to, sir, but her mother won't let her."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go."</p>

<p>And he resumed his work. "7 and 5 are 12, and 8 are
20; two 1's are 2&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but two ones want to be made one."</p>

<p>"How is that&mdash;what do you want?"</p>

<p>Reader, will you just turn to the illustration of the couple
that now presented themselves as candidates for matrimony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The delineator and engraver have made one of the most perfect
daguerreian pictures ever got up from description.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"We want to be married, sir."</p>

<p>"Want to be married&mdash;what for?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, we don't think it is right for us to be living
together this way any longer, and we have been talking over
the matter to-day, and you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see you have been talking over the matter over
the bottle, and have come to a sort of drunken conclusion to
get married. When you get sober, you will both repent it,
probably."</p>

<p>"No, sir, we are not very drunk now, not so drunk but
what we can think, and we don't think we are doing right&mdash;we
are not doing as we were brought up to do by pious
parents. We have been reading about the good things you
have done for just such poor outcasts as we are, and we want
you to try and do something for us."</p>

<p>"Read! can you read? Do you read the Bible?"</p>

<p>"Well, not much lately, but we read the newspapers, and
sometimes we read something good in them. How can we
read the Bible when we are drunk?"</p>

<p>"Do you think getting married will keep you from getting
drunk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for we are going to take the pledge too, and we shall
keep it, depend upon that."</p>

<p>"Suppose you take the pledge and try that first, and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
can keep it till you can wash some of the dirt away, and get
some clothes on, then I will marry you."</p>

</div>

<p>"No; that won't do. I shall get to thinking what a poor,
dirty, miserable wretch I am, and how I am living with this
woman, who is not a bad woman by nature; and then I will
drink, and then she will drink&mdash;oh, cursed rum!&mdash;and what
is to prevent us? But if we were married, my wife, yes, Mr.
Pease, my wife, would say, 'Thomas'&mdash;she would not say, 'Tom,
you dirty brute,'&mdash;'don't be tempted;' and who knows but
we might be somebody yet&mdash;somebody that our own mothers
would not be ashamed of?"</p>

<p>Here the woman, who had been silent and rather moody,
burst into a violent flood of tears, crying, "Mother, mother, I
know not whether she is alive or not, and dare not inquire;
but if we were married and reformed, I would make her
happy once more."</p>

<p>"I could no longer resist the appeal," said Mr. P., "and
determined to give them a trial. I have married a good
many poor, wretched-looking couples, but none that looked
quite so much so as this. The man was hatless and shoeless,
without coat or vest, with long hair and beard grimed with dirt.
He was by trade a bricklayer, one of the best in the city. The
woman wore the last remains of a silk bonnet, and something
that might pass for shoes, and an old, very old dress,
once a rich merino, apparently without any under garments."</p>

<p>"Your name is Thomas&mdash;Thomas what?"</p>

<p>"Elting, sir. Thomas Elting, a good, true name and true
man; that is, shall be, if you marry us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well. I am going to marry you."</p>

<p>"Are you? There, Mag, I told you so."</p>

<p>"Don't call me Mag. If I am going to be married, it shall
be by my right name, the one my mother gave me."</p>

<p>"Not Mag? Well, I never knew that."</p>

<p>"Now, Thomas, hold your tongue, you talk too much.
What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Matilda. Must I tell you the other? Yes, I will, and I
never will disgrace it. I don't think, I should ever have been
as bad if I had kept it. That bad woman who first tempted
me to ruin, made me take a false name. They always do that,
sir, and so she said I must take another name, I did not know
what for then; and so they called me Mag, and that is the
name he knows me by, and I never would have told him my
right name, only that we are going to get married, and
reform."</p>

<p>Could they do it&mdash;could beings sunk so low, reform? We
shall see.</p>

<p>"It is a bad thing, sir, for a girl to give up her name unless
for that of a good husband. Matilda Morgan. Nobody
that is good knows me by any other name in this bad city."</p>

<p>Yes, it is a bad thing for a girl to give up her own name
for a fictitious one. I could tell a touching story of an instance
of a poor sewing woman, who went to one of these name-changing
houses to work, not to sin, who was coaxed to be
called Lucy, instead of her own sweet name of Athalia, and
how she was accidentally discovered and rescued from the
very jaws of ruin by her own uncle. But not now, I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>go on with the marriage. The bride and bridegroom are
waiting, and the reader for a share of the feast.</p>

<p>"Now I am going to join you two in wedlock; it cannot
make you worse, it may better. Look me in the face. Now,
Matilda and Thomas, take each other by the right hand, look
at me, while I unite you in the holy bonds of marriage by God's
ordinance. Do you think you are sufficiently sober to comprehend
its solemnity?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Marriage being one of God's holy ordinances, cannot
be kept in sin, misery, filth, and drunkenness. Thomas,
will you take Matilda to be your lawful, true, only, wedded
wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You promise that you will live with her, in sickness as
well as health, and nourish, protect, and comfort her as your
true and faithful wife; that you will be to her a true and
faithful husband; that you will not get drunk, and will clothe
yourself and keep clean?"</p>

<p>"So I will."</p>

<p>"Never mind answering until I get through. You promise
to abstain totally from every kind of drink that intoxicates,
and treat this woman kindly, affectionately, and love her as a
husband should love his wedded wife. Now, all of this will
you, here before me as the servant of the Most High,&mdash;here,
in the sight of God, in heaven, most faithfully promise, if I
give you this woman to be your wedded wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you, Matilda, on your part, will you promise the
same, and be a true wife to this man?"</p>

<p>"I will try, sir."</p>

<p>"But do you promise all this faithfully?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I will."</p>

<p>It was a woman's "I will," spoken right out with a good,
hearty emphasis, that told, as it always tells, the faith and
truth of woman, when she says, "I will."</p>

<p>"Then I pronounce you man and wife."</p>

<p>"Now, Thomas," says the new wife, after I had made out
the certificate and given it to her, with an injunction to keep
it safely&mdash;"now pay Mr. Pease, and let us go home and break
the bottle." Thomas felt first in the right pocket, then the
left, then back to the right, then he examined the watch fob.</p>

<p>It is probable that the former owner of this principal article
of his wardrobe, owned a watch. It is more likely that the
present owner had been often in the hands of the watch, than
that he had often had a watch in his hands. He was
evidently searching for lost treasures.</p>

<p>"Why, where is it?" says she. "You had two dollars this
morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it; but I have only got two cents this evening.
There, Mr. Pease, take them. It is all I have got in
the world&mdash;what more can I give?"</p>

<p>Sure enough; what could he do more? He took them and
prayed over them, that in parting with the last penny, this
couple might have parted with a vice&mdash;a wicked, foolish practice,
which had reduced them to such a degree of poverty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
wretchedness, that the monster power of rum could hardly
send its victims lower.</p>

<p>So, by a few words, I hope, words of power to do good,
Thomas and Matilda, long known as, drunken Tom and Mag,
were transformed into Mr. and Mrs. Elting, and having grown
somewhat more sober while in the house, seemed to fully
understand their new position, and all the obligations they
had taken upon themselves.</p>

<p>"For a few days," said Mr. P., "I thought occasionally of
this two-penny marriage, and then it became absorbed with a
thousand other scenes of wretchedness which I have witnessed
since I have lived in this centre of city misery. Time
wore on, and I married many other couples; often those who
came in their carriage and left a golden marriage fee&mdash;a delicate
way of giving to the needy&mdash;but among all, I had never
performed the rite for a couple quite so low as that of this
two-penny fee, and I resolved I never would again. At
length, however, I had a call from a full match to them, which
I refused."</p>

<p>"Why do you come to me to be married, my friend?" said
I to the man. "You are both too poor to live separate;
and, besides, you are both terrible drunkards, I know you are."</p>

<p>"That is just what we want to get married for, and take
the pledge."</p>

<p>"Take that first."</p>

<p>"No; we must take all together&mdash;nothing else will save
us."</p>

<p>"Will that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"It did one of my friends."</p>

<p>"Well, then, go and bring that friend here; let me see and
hear how much it saved him, and then I will make up my
mind what to do. If I can do you any good, I want to do
it."</p>

<p>"My friend is at work&mdash;he has got a good job and several
hands working for him, and is making money, and won't quit
till night. Shall I come this evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will stay at home and wait for you."</p>

<p>He little expected to see him again, but about eight o'clock
the servant said that man and his girl, with a <i>gentleman</i> and
<i>lady</i>, were waiting in the reception room. He told him to
ask the lady and gentleman to walk up to the parlor and sit
a moment, while he sent the candidates for marriage away,
being determined never to unite another drunken couple, not
dreaming that there was any sympathy between the parties.
But they would not come up; they wanted to see that couple
married. So he went down, and found the squalidly wretched
pair, that had been there in the morning, in conversation, and
apparently very friendly and intimate, with the lady and gentleman.
He had the appearance of a well dressed laboring
man, for he wore a fine black coat, silk vest, gold watch-chain,
clean white shirt and cravat, polished calf-skin boots; and his
wife was just as neat and tidily dressed as anybody's wife, and
her face beamed with intelligence, and the way in which she
clung to the arm of her husband, as she seemed to shrink
out of sight, told that she was a loving as well as a pretty
wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"This couple," said the gentleman, "have come to be
married."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it," said Mr. P., "and I have refused. Look
at them; do they look like fit subjects for such a holy ordinance?
God never intended those, whom he created in his
own image, should live in matrimony like this man and woman.
I cannot marry them."</p>

<p>"Cannot! Why not? You married us when we were
worse off&mdash;more dirty&mdash;worse clothed, and more intoxicated."</p>

<p>"The woman shrunk back a little more out of sight. I saw
she trembled violently, and put her clean cambric handkerchief
up to her eyes."</p>

<p>"What could it mean? Married them when worse off?
Who were they?"</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten us?" said the woman, taking my hands
in hers, and dropping on her knees; "have you forgotten
drunken Tom and Mag? We have never forgotten you, but
pray for you every day!"</p>

<p>"If you have forgotten them, you have not forgotten the
two-penny marriage. No wonder you did not know us. I
told Matilda she need not be afraid, or ashamed, if you did
know her. But I knew you would not. How could you?
We were in rags and dirt then. Look at us now. All your
work, sir. All the blessing of the pledge and that marriage,
and that good advice you gave us. Look at this suit of clothes,
and her dress&mdash;all Matilda's work, every stitch of it. Come
and look at our house, as neat as she is. Everything in it to
make a comfortable home; and, oh! sir, there is a cradle in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
bedroom. Five hundred dollars already in bank, and I shall
add as much more next week when I finish my job. So much
for one year of a sober life, and a faithful, honest, good wife.
Now, this man is as good a workman as I am, only he is bound
down with the galling fetters of drunkenness, and living with
a woman as I did, only worse, for they have two children.
What will they be, if they chance to live, and grow up to
womanhood in Cow Bay? Now he has made up his mind to
try to be a man again&mdash;he is a beast now&mdash;he thinks that he
can reform just as well as me; but he thinks he must take the
pledge of the same man, and have his first effort sanctified
with the same blessing, and then, with a good resolution, and
Matilda and me to watch over them, I do believe they will
succeed."</p>

<p>So they did. So may others, by the same means.</p>

<p>They were married, solemnly, impressively, solemnly married;
and pledged to total abstinence in the most earnest
manner; and promised most faithfully, not only to keep the
pledge, but to do unto others, as Elting had done unto them.
Both promises you have seen that they have kept well.</p>

<p>As they were parting, Elting slipped something into Nolan's
hand, and told him to pay the marriage fee.</p>

<p>"I thought," said the missionary, "of the two pennies, and
expected nothing more, and therefore was not disappointed
when he handed me the two reddish-looking coins. I thought,
well, they are bright, new looking cents, at any rate, and I
hope their lives will be like them. I was in hopes that it
might have been a couple of dollars this time, but I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
nothing, and we parted with a mutual God bless you. When
I went up stairs, I tossed the coin into my wife's lap, with the
remark, 'two pennies again, my dear.'"</p>

<p>"Two pennies! Why, husband, they are eagles&mdash;real
golden eagles. What a deal of good they will do. What
blessings have followed that act."</p>

<p>And what blessings did follow the last one; will always
follow the pledge faithfully kept; will always follow a well
formed, faithfully kept union, even if it is a "two-penny marriage."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>I have still another little episode in this life drama&mdash;a
scene in one of the acts, which we may as well put upon the
stage at this point of the story, though it is quite unconnected
with those that immediately precede it; yet you will find a
character here, in whom you have, perhaps, taken some interest.
It is the termination of the story of the Hot Corn girl,
whom you read about in chapter second, whose portrait you
have already looked at in the frontispiece of this volume.</p>

<p>You have read in the story of Little Katy, what a world of
cheap happiness can be bought with a shilling. No one of
the thousand silver coins wasted that night in hotel, saloon,
bar-room, grocery, or rum hole, gave the waster half the
pleasure that that shilling gave to three individuals&mdash;he that
gave and those who received. No ice-cream, cake, jelly, or
health-destroying candy, tasted half so sweet as the bread purchased
with that sixpence.</p>

<p>No man ever made so small an investment, that paid so
well, both in a pecuniary point of view and large increase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
human happiness, for it has been the means of waking up
benevolence, not dead but sleeping, to look about and inquire,
what shall I do to remove this misery-producing curse from
among us? Thousands have read the story of Little Katy, and
thousands of little hearts have been touched. Many hands
have been opened&mdash;more will be. These little stories, detailing
some of the sufferings which crime and misery bring upon
the poor of this city, will be, as some of them already have
been, read with tearful eyes. You have read the story of a
poor neglected child of a drunken mother&mdash;not always so&mdash;wasting
her young life away with no object but to live, with no
thought of death. It is a sad tale, and it is not yet finished.
The next night after the interview with that neglected, ill-used
little girl, the same plaintive cry of "Hot corn, hot corn!&mdash;here's
your nice hot corn!" came up through our open window,
on the midnight air, while the rain came dripping down
from the overcharged clouds, in just sufficient quantities to
wet the thin single garment of the owner of that sweet young
voice, without giving her an acceptable excuse for leaving her
post before her hard task was completed.</p>

<p>At length the voice grew faint, and then ceased altogether,
and then I knew that exhausted nature slept&mdash;that a tender
house-plant was exposed to the chilling influence of a night
rain&mdash;that an innocent girl had the curb-stone for a bed and
an iron post for a pillow&mdash;that by and by she would awaken,
not invigorated with refreshing slumber, but poisoned with
the sleep-inhaled miasma of the filth-reeking gutter at her
feet, which may he breathed with impunity awake, but like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the malaria of our southern coast, is death to the sleeper.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
Not soothed by a dreamy consciousness of hearing a mother's
voice tuning a soft lullaby of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hush, my child, lie still and slumber;"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>but starting like a sentinel upon a savage frontier post, with
alarm at having slept; shivering with night air and fear, and,
finally, compelled to go home, trembling like a culprit, to hear
the harsh words of a mother&mdash;yes, a mother&mdash;but oh! what a
mother&mdash;cursing her for not performing an impossibility,
because exhausted nature slept&mdash;because her child had not
made a profit which would have enabled her more freely to
indulge in the soul and body-destroying vice of drunkenness,
to which she had fallen from an estate, when "my carriage"
was one of the "household words" which used to greet the
young ears of that poor little death-stricken, neglected, street
sufferer.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> On many of the Rice and Sea Island plantations in South Carolina
and Georgia, in fact upon almost all the coast lands of these States, the
malaria is so deadly in its effects upon the sleeper, that every effort is
made to keep awake by those who are accidentally exposed for a single
night to its influence. Many of the most beautiful residences in the
vicinity of Charleston, are uninhabited by white persons in summer.
The negroes are not at all, or only slightly affected. The overseers
often have a little cabin in the most convenient pine woods, to which
they retire before nightfall.</p></div>

<p>No doubt, though to a less deadly degree, the malaria arises from the
filth in our dirty streets, killing its thousands of little children every
year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>It was past midnight when she awoke, and found herself,
with a desperate effort, just able to reach the bottom of the
rickety stairs which led to her <i>home</i>. We shall not go up
now. In a little while, reader, you shall see where live the
city poor.</p>

<p>You shall go with me at midnight to the <i>Home of little
Katy</i>. You shall see where she lies upon her straw pallet in
a miserable garret; yet she was born in as rich a chamber as
you or you, who tread upon soft Turkey carpets when you go
to your downy couches.</p>

<p>Wait a little.</p>

<p>Tired&mdash;worn with the daily toil&mdash;for such is the work of an
editor who caters for the appetites of his morning readers&mdash;I
was not present the next night to note the absence of that
cry from its accustomed spot; but the next and next, and still
on, I listened in vain&mdash;that voice was not there. True, the
same hot-corn cry came floating upon the evening breeze
across the park, or wormed its way from some cracked-fiddle
voice down the street, up and around the corner, or out of
some dark alley, with a broken English accent, that sounded
almost as much like "lager bier" as it did like the commodity
the immigrant, struggling to eke out his precarious existence,
wished to sell. All over this great poverty-burdened, and
wicked waste, extravagant city, at this season, that cry goes
up, nightly proclaiming one of the habits of this late-supper
eating people.</p>

<p>Yes, I missed that cry. "Hot Corn" was no longer like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
music of a stringed instrument to a weary man, for the treble-string
was broken, and, for me the harmony spoiled.</p>

<p>Who shall say there is not music in those two little words?
"Hot Corn" shall yet be trilled from boudoir and parlor,
as fairy fingers run over the piano keys. Hot Corn! Hot Corn!
shall yet be the chorus of the minstrel's song, and hot tears
shall flow at the remembrance of "Little Katy." But that
one song had ceased. That voice came not upon my listening
ear.</p>

<p>What was that voice to me? It was but one in a thousand,
just as miserable, which may be daily heard where human
misery has its abode. That voice, as some others have, did
not haunt me, but its absence, in spite of all reasoning, made
me feel uneasy. I do not believe in spiritual manifestations
half as strongly as some of the costermongers of the fruits of
other men's brains, who eke out their existence by retailing
petty scandal to long-eared listeners, would have them believe;
yet I do believe there is a spirit in man, not yet made manifest,
which makes us yearn after coexisting spirits in this
sphere and in this life, and that there is no need of going beyond
it, after strange idols.</p>

<p>I shall not stop to inquire whether it was a spirit of "the
first, third or sixth sphere," that prompted me, as I left my
desk one evening, to go down among the abodes of the poor,
with a feeling of certainty that I should see or hear something
of the lost voice, or what spirit led me on; perhaps it was the
spirit of curiosity; no matter, it led, and I followed, in the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I had seen that little one go before&mdash;it was my only cue&mdash;I
knew no name&mdash;had no number, nor knew any one that knew
her whom I was going to find. Yes, I knew that good Missionary;
and she had told me of the good words which he had
spoken; but would he know her from the hundred just like
her? Perhaps. It will cost nothing to inquire. I went
down Centre street with a light heart; I turned into Cross
street with a step buoyed with hope; I stood at the corner of
Little-Water street, and looked around inquiringly of the
spirit, and mentally said, "which way now?" The answer
was a far-off scream of despair. I stood still with an open ear,
for the sound of prayer, followed by a sweet hymn of praise to
God, went up from the site of the Old Brewery, in which I
joined, thankful that that was no longer the abode of all the
worst crimes ever concentrated under one roof. Hark! a step
approaches. My unseen guide whispered, "ask him." It were
a curious question to ask a stranger, in such a strange place,
particularly one like him, haggard with over much care, toil,
or mental labor. Prematurely old, his days shortened by overwork
in his young years, as his furrowed face and almost frenzied
eye hurriedly indicate, as we see the flash of the lamp upon
his dark visage, as he approaches with that peculiar American
step which impels the body forward at railroad speed. Shall
I get out of his way before he walks over me? What if he is
a crazy man? No; the spirit was right&mdash;no false raps here.
It is that good missionary. That man who has done more to
reform that den of crime, the Five Points of New-York, than
all the Municipal Authorities of this Police-hunting, and Prison-punishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
city, where misfortune is deemed a crime, or the
unfortunate driven to it, by the way they are treated with harsh
words, damp cells&mdash;death cells&mdash;and cold prison-bars, instead
of being reformed, or strengthened in their resolution to reform,
by kind words; means to earn food, rather than forced to steal
it; by schools and infant-teaching, rather than old offenders-punishing.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Mr. Pease, "what brings you here at this time
of night, for I know there is an object; can I aid you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, I don't know&mdash;a foolish whim&mdash;a little child&mdash;one
of the miserable, with a drunken mother."</p>

<p>"Come with me, then. There are many such. I am just
going to visit one, who will die before morning&mdash;a sweet little
girl, born in better days, and dying now&mdash;but you shall
see, and then we will talk about the one you would seek to
save."</p>

<p>We were soon treading a narrow alley, where pestilence
walketh in darkness; and crime, wretched poverty, and filthy
misery, go hand in hand to destruction.</p>

<p>"Behold," said my friend, "the fruits of our city excise.
Here is the profit of money spent for license to kill the body
and damn the soul." Proven by the awful curses and loud
blows of a drunken husband upon a wife, once an ornament of
society, and exemplary member of a Christian church, that
came up out of one of the low cellars, which human beings
call by the holy name of home!</p>

<p>The fetid odor of this filthy lane had been made more fetid
by the late and almost scalding hot rains, until it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
us that such an air was only fit for a charnel house. With
the thermometer at 86, at midnight, how could men live in
such a place, below the surface of the earth? Has rum rendered
them proof against the effect of carbonic acid gas?</p>

<p>We groped our way along to the foot of an outside stair-case,
where our conductor paused for a moment, calling my
attention to the spot. "Here," said Mr. Pease, "the little
sufferer we are going to see, fainted a few nights ago, and lay
all night exposed to the rain, where she was found and beaten
in the morning by her miserable mother, just then coming
home from a night of debauch and licentiousness, with a man
who would be ashamed to visit her in her habitation, or have
'the world' know that he consorted with a street wanderer."</p>

<p>"Beat her! for what?"</p>

<p>"Because she had not sold all her corn, which she had been
sent out with the evening before. Poor thing, she had fallen
asleep, and some villain had robbed her of her little store, and,
as it is with greater crimes, the wicked escaped and the innocent
suffered."</p>

<p>I thought aloud:</p>

<p>"Great and unknown cause, hast thou brought me to her
very door?"</p>

<p>My friend stared, but did not comprehend the expression.
"Be careful," said he, "the stairs are very old, and slippery."</p>

<p>"Beat her?" said I, without regarding what he was saying.</p>

<p>"Yes, beat her, while she was in a fever of delirium, from
which she has never rallied. She has never spoken rationally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
since she was taken. Her constant prayer seems to be
to see some particular person before she dies.</p>

<p>"'Oh, if I could see him once more&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;that is
him&mdash;no, no, he did not speak that way to me&mdash;he did not
curse and beat me.'</p>

<p>"Such is her conversation, and that induced her mother to
send for me, but I was not the man. 'Will he come?' she
says, every time I visit her; for, thinking to soothe and comfort
her, I promised to bring him."</p>

<p>We had reached the top of the stairs, and stood a moment
at the open door, where sin and misery dwelt, where sickness
had come, and where death would soon enter.</p>

<p>"Will he come?"</p>

<p>A faint voice came up from a low bed in one corner, seen
by the very dim light of a miserable lamp.</p>

<p>That voice. I could not be mistaken. I could not enter.
Let me wait a moment in the open air, for there is a choking
sensation coming over me.</p>

<p>"Come in," said my friend.</p>

<p>"Will he come?"</p>

<p>Two hands were stretched out imploringly towards the Missionary,
as the sound of his voice was recognised.</p>

<p>"She is much weaker to-night," said her mother, in quite a
lady-like manner, for the sense of her drunken wrong to her
dying child had kept her sober, ever since she had been sick;
"but she is quite delirious, and all the time talking about that
man who spoke kindly to her one night in the Park, and gave
her money to buy bread."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will he come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; through the guidance of the good spirit that
rules the world, and leads us by unseen paths, through dark
places, for His own wise purposes, <i>he has come</i>."</p>

<p>The little emaciated form started up in bed, and a pair of
beautiful, soft blue eyes glanced around the room, peering
through the semi-darkness, as if in search of something heard
but unseen.</p>

<p>"Katy, darling," said the mother, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Where is he, mother? He is here. I heard him speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, sweet little innocent, he is here, kneeling by your
bedside. There, lay down, you are very sick."</p>

<p>"Only once, just once, let me put my arms around your
neck, and kiss you, just as I used to kiss papa. I had a papa
once, when we lived in the big house&mdash;there, there. Oh, I did
want to see you, to thank you for the bread and the cakes; I
was very hungry, and it did taste so good&mdash;and little Sis, she
waked up, and she eat and eat, and after a while she went to
sleep with a piece in her hand, and I went to sleep; hav'n't I
been asleep a good while? I thought I was asleep in the
Park, and somebody stole all my corn, and my mother whipt
me for it, but I could not help it. Oh dear, I feel sleepy now.
I can't talk any more. I am very tired. I cannot see; the
candle has gone out. I think I am going to die. I thank
you; I wanted to thank you for the bread&mdash;I thought you
would not come. Good bye&mdash;Sissy, good bye. Sissy&mdash;you
will come&mdash;mother&mdash;don't&mdash;drink&mdash;any more&mdash;Mother&mdash;good
b&mdash;."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis the last of earth," said the good man at our side&mdash;"let
us pray."</p>

<p>Reader, Christian reader, little Katy is in her grave.
Prayers for her are unavailing. There are in this city a thousand
just such cases. Prayers for them are unavailing. Faith
without works, works not reform. A faithful, prayerful resolution,
to work out that reform which will save you from reading
the recital of such scenes&mdash;such fruits of the rum trade as this
before you, will work together for your own and others' good.
Go forth and listen. If you hear a little voice crying <i>Hot
Corn!</i> think of poor Katy, and of the hosts of innocents slain
by that remorseless tyrant&mdash;rum. Go forth and seek a better
spirit to rule over us. Cry aloud, "Will he come," and the
answer will be, "Yes, yes, he is here."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<blockquote><p>The commendation given to these stories, as they were published in
the <i>Tribune</i>, was an inducement for me to "keep the cry of <i>Hot Corn</i>
before the people," for I saw that they appreciated my labors; and I set
about collecting other materials, and writing out notes made during
many a night-watch among the habitations of men, yet the abodes of
misery, with which this city abounds.</p>

<p>Many an anxious mind, after conning the preceding chapters, has
yearned after further knowledge touching the things therein hinted at.
Many have asked to know more of "Sissy," and Little Katy's mother.
It is a laudable curiosity: it shall be gratified in due time. I have
other stories&mdash;other scenes where you may stop a moment and drop a
tear, and then we will walk on with our Life Scenes. First we will
finish that of Maggie's mother.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="h3">MAGGIE'S MOTHER.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let go thy hold&mdash;the glass has run out its sands&mdash;the wheel goes down hill.<br></span>
<span class="i2">There is a time to mourn.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Reagan took the pledge, and took up his residence at that
house of the destitute. At first, he did not ask to live with
his wife. He said, he was not worthy of her. He begged
Tom to write to Maggie: "I know it will make her happy
to learn that I am here." So it did. The rose had another
rival now. Her cheeks blossomed afresh. Reagan worked
busily&mdash;he did up a great many little jobs of joiner-work;
and when there was nothing more to do at that, he said, let
me go into the bake-shop, shoe-shop, anywhere. I will sit
down with those women and use the needle, rather than be
idle, or venture out where tempters will beset me. So he
went on for some time, till he grew stronger and gained more
confidence&mdash;his wife strengthened him by her counsel, and
then he ventured out to work where he could earn good
wages. It was curious to see him go quite out of his way,
around a whole square, perhaps, to avoid going by one of his
old haunts.</p>

<p>"I have suffered so much," said he to me one day, "from
the temptation of these places, where the liquor is placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
our sight on purpose to allure and whet our depraved appetites,
that it is no wonder that the poor inebriate loses his
balance and falls into the abyss. If there was no liquor in
sight, there would be no danger of our falling back into old
habits. I never should think of going to look after it. The
danger is when it is thrust right under my nose. Oh, that
these rum shops might be shut up, or at least, kept out of
sight!"</p>

<p>This was the earnest prayer of one who knew the demon
power of temptation which one, who is trying to reform, has
constantly to combat with.</p>

<p>Those who sell liquor know the advantage to them of this
temptation. So they fix up the street corners with all the
enticing attractions of artistic skill. The cool ice water; the
free lunch; the ever-burning light for the smoker's convenience;
the arm-chair and easy lounge, and cool room in
summer, or well heated one in winter; the ever open, always
free resting-place for the tired walker, or ennui-tormented genteel
loafer, are only a few of the inducements to just "step
in a moment;" and then the old appetite is aroused by the
sight and smell of liquor in the glistening array of cut glass,
and by the influence of a score of old companions standing
before the bar&mdash;they will stand before another bar
hereafter&mdash;or sitting at the little white marble tables, sipping
or sucking "sherry cobblers" and "mint juleps" through a
glass "straw."</p>

<p>Woe to the tired walker who has been tempted into one
of these invitingly open rooms. If he has the power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
resist his own inclination to drink, he may not have enough
to resist the persuasion of half a dozen of his acquaintances,
or the force of crazed brains and strong hands, by which he
is dragged up and held, while they merit the curse denounced
upon those who "put the cup to their neighbor's lips." Perhaps
he will be taunted with meanness for coming in to
drink water and rest himself, "and not patronise the house."</p>

<p>From this, those of us who desire to see those places of
temptation shut up, may take the hint.</p>

<p>Let reading rooms be opened, free to all who choose to
come in and read the papers, drink ice water, and enjoy their
rest in the shade, or partake of the comforts of a warm room,
for a five cent fee. A coffee and tea room, strictly so, may
be attached. How much better than drinking such liquor as
those who visit all our public places must do, or be set down
as mean. "Let them stay at home," is a common answer to
those who say they fell by the temptations of such places.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Jim Reagan to me one day, "that we have
no home. That was my case when I was a young man. I
lived in a common boarding-house; in my little uncomfortable
room I would not stay; where else had I to go but the
public bar room, and there I learned to drink; I was a good
fellow then; a genteel young man, and married a genteel
young girl; I did not go down all at once&mdash;it was step by
step, slow but sure&mdash;to Cale Jones's grocery and the Centre
street cellar."</p>

<p>True, thought I, as I entered the front door of the first hotel
in this great metropolis, the largest in America, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
through the splendid marble hall, two hundred feet long,
lighted by glittering chandeliers, into the immense drinking
saloon of that fashionable place of resort; and I said to
myself, "some of these fine forms of men, clothed in fine
linen and rich broad cloth, may some day fall as low as thee,
poor Jim Reagan. You began your course in just such a
genteel drinking room."</p>

<p>"Yes," says he, "and the first drink I ever took in one, for
I was brought up a temperance boy, I was dragged up by the
strength of two companions, and held while the bar-keeper
baptised me, as he called it, by pouring the liquor down my
throat, over my head, and saturating my clothes till the smell
made me sick, and then they gave me more to settle it. 'A
hair of the same dog,' said they, 'will cure the bite.' Bite it
was. No mad dog's bite ever caused more sin and sorrow
than that bite did me. We cry, 'mad dog,' and kill the poor
brute; the worse than brute we 'license' to live."</p>

<p>Thus he would sit and talk by the hour. "If I can only
keep out of the way of the tempters," said he, "I never shall
drink again."</p>

<p>He was now accumulating money; he always came home
to sleep, "for," says he, "I feel, as sure as I enter this door,
that I am safe."</p>

<p>It was determined, as soon as Maggie came again, that
they would go to keeping house. "If that blessed child
was only with me," said the father, as the tears rolled down
his furrowed cheeks, "I should feel as though I had a shield&mdash;through
which none of these traffickers in human souls could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
reach me. My wife is like an aged counsellor, there is wisdom
in her every word, but she cannot go out through the streets,
leaning upon my arm, still full of manly strength, like Maggie,
while I lean upon her still greater strength&mdash;the strength
and might of a strong mind."</p>

<p>"Here is a letter from our dear child," said Mrs. Reagan to
her husband, one evening as he came in from work. "Sit
down and read it aloud, for some how, my old eyes get dim
every time I try; I cannot imagine what is the matter with
them."</p>

<p>I can. They were full of tears. Strange, that we shed
bitter and sweet water from the same fountain.</p>

<p>Reagan put on his spectacles, took the letter, looked at the
first words, took them off, wiped the glasses, looked again,
repeated the operation, laid both letter and spectacles upon
the table, got up and walked the room back and forth, then
he tried to speak&mdash;to utter the first words of that letter; if he
could get over that he could go on, but he could not, they
stuck in his throat. At length he got them up&mdash;"Dear father
and mother, I am coming home to kiss you both." Simple
words! Common every-day words. But they were strong
words, for they had overcome the strength of a strong man,
and he fell upon his wife's neck and wept like a child.</p>

<p>"Such words to me&mdash;me who have kicked, and cuffed, and
froze, and starved, and abused that child for years. Oh, God,
preserve my life to make her ample amends for my wrongs
and her love! Oh, God, preserve her life to make us both
happy, and drop a tear at our grave!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Prayer calms the spirit. Realization and acknowledgment
of sin soothes the soul.</p>

<p>Reagan could now read the letter without difficulty. His
spectacles did not need wiping again. It was dated,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Near <span class="smcap">Katona</span>, Westchester County, New York.<br>
<br>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Father and Mother</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>"I am coming home to kiss you both. I don't know but
I shall kiss Tom, for he has written me all about it&mdash;I know
it all&mdash;I know how you was brought in, and how you took
the pledge, and how you have kept it, and how industrious
you have been, and how you have saved your money, and
how you want to go to housekeeping again, and all about it&mdash;I
know it all. Tom writes me every week. He is a good boy.
Well, in two months I am coming down. You need not look
for me before, and then, if you want me, I will come and live
with you."</p></blockquote>

<p>"If we want her! Did you ever hear the like? But, then,
what is she to do? She is a big girl now, and must not be
idle. I wish she had a trade. Every child ought to have a
trade."</p>

<p>"Well, well, wife, let us have the balance of the letter."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, go on; you need not mind what I say. Go on."</p>

<p>"Let me see; where was I? 'Come and live with you,'
that's it."</p>

<blockquote><p>"And now I must tell you such a piece of news&mdash;good
news. Oh, it was a good thing I came up here. I have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a trade&mdash;a trade that will support us all when you get so you
cannot work."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Heaven bless the girl, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Do wait, wife, and you shall hear."</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is a nice, genteel trade, too. Now we will take a house,
and father will work at his trade, and mother will do the
house-work, and I will work at my trade, and we shall live so
happy."</p></blockquote>

<p>"So we shall. But, dear me, why don't she tell what
it is?"</p>

<p>"So she will if you let me alone. A girl must have her
own way to tell it; probably she will do that in a postscript."</p>

<p>"Well, read on. I am so impatient."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to know what my trade is?"</p>

<p>"Why to be sure we should. Why don't she tell?"</p>

<blockquote><p>"So I will tell you. I am a stock-maker&mdash;those things the
gentlemen wear round their necks. And it is very curious
how I learned the trade. A lady from New York&mdash;oh, she
is a lady!&mdash;came up here on a visit, and for work she brought
along some stocks to make. She lives in New York. I
believe she keeps a few boarders, and makes stocks. She is a
widow lady, quite young, and very pretty, only she is in bad
health; she has no family, only her uncle, who is an old
bachelor&mdash;a nice old gentleman, who has adopted her as
his daughter, and is going to give her all he has when he
dies. She has no father and mother, as I have, and no
brothers and sisters; nobody to love but the old uncle&mdash;he
does love her, so do I. I did not at first. I was afraid of her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I thought she was some grand city lady; and she used to sit
and sew in her room, only when her uncle&mdash;Papa she calls
him, and he calls her daughter&mdash;'Athalia, daughter,' so sweet;
is it not a sweet name? Her name is Athalia Morgan&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Morgan, Morgan&mdash;Athalia Morgan. I will warrant it is
she. Don't you remember, wife, that old Morgan, the great
shipping merchant? his son married a sewing girl, and his
sister married George Wendall."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, how singular! It was she that was talking when
Maggie took me into the temperance meeting that night,
telling how her husband died. And now Maggie has met
with another of the family. And her husband must be dead
too."</p>

<p>"Yes, he died just as miserable a death as Wendall. Let
us read on and see what of his wife. I hope he did not drag
her down with him as I did mine."</p>

<p>"James, James, you are not to speak of anything that is
past."</p>

<p>"Well, well," and he brushed away another tear and
read on:</p>

<blockquote><p>"After she had been here a few days, our folks told her
about me, and how I used to run the streets, and how I got
into the House of Industry, and how they got me from there,
and what a good girl I had been&mdash;yes, they did&mdash;and then
Mrs. Morgan, she began to talk to me so kindly; and then I
told her everything about myself, and some about you, and
she told me a great many things about herself. Oh, it would
be such a story to put in a book. And then she grew as fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of me as I was of her. And every day when I had my work
done, and every evening, I used to be up in her room, and she
showed me all about her work, and I used to help her, and
now she declares that I can make just as good a stock as she
can, and almost as fast. She can make eight in a day; when
I help her, odd times and evenings, she can make twelve.
Last week she made, with what I did, seventy-two, and put
them all in a box. How nice they do look! That is seventy-two
York shillings&mdash;nine dollars! And she says when I come
home to live, she will recommend me&mdash;I must have a good
recommend to get work&mdash;when I can get just as much such
work as I can do. Oh, but she is a good woman! I guess
you would cry though as much as I have, to hear her story.
I will tell it you some day. Mrs. Morgan is going down to-morrow.
I wish I was. But I cannot. In two months my
time is up; then you will see me. Now, good night. Say
'good by' to Tom for me. Kiss mother, father, and ever
love your</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Maggie.</span>"<br>
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Oh, James, something tells me that if she don't come
before that, I never shall see her. But you will be happy
with her. You will live a long life, I hope, for her to bless
and comfort you in your old age. You are not so old and so
broken down as I am."</p>

<p>"All my fault, all my fault. If I had treated you as a
rational man should treat a wife, you would not be so broken
down now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must not look back. Look ahead and aloft. Think
what a treasure of a daughter you have got. How I should
like to see her once more before I go to my rest, and give her
my blessing; and oh! how I should like to see that blessed
woman, that Mrs. Morgan. I want to bring her and Elsie
together, and make peace on earth as there will be in heaven,
where I hope to meet them both. They will soon follow.
This life, at best, is short. Mine will be, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Don't have such gloomy forebodings, wife; it seems to
me that you were never in better health."</p>

<p>"I know it, and never more happy."</p>

<p>This was on Thursday evening. On Saturday evening
everybody was astonished to see Maggie come bounding in,
with a step as light and quick as a playful lamb.</p>

<p>"Where's mother? Is she well? Has anything happened?
Where is father? Is everything all right with him?" were
the questions she asked, in such rapid succession that nobody
could answer any one of them.</p>

<p>"Where is Tom? Is he well? Where is Mr. Pease
and Mrs. Pease? Are they well? Is mother in the kitchen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes, yes, to the whole string."</p>

<p>Away she went, three stairs at a time, and then she almost
overwhelmed her mother with kisses and questions; and up
she went to the third story, and there was father in his room,
reading the Bible. When had she ever seen that before?
The last time she saw him, he was so dreadfully intoxicated
that he did not know his own child, that was lifting him out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of the gutter. Now he was sober, well clothed, cheerful, and
happy. As she opened the door he read:</p>

<p>"Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions?
who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause?
who hath redness of eyes?</p>

<p>"They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek
mixed wine.</p>

<p>"Look not thou upon the wine when it is red; when it
giveth his color in the cup; when it moveth itself aright.</p>

<p>"At the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an
adder.</p>

<p>"Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he looked up, as his ear caught a little rustle of a
woman's clothes, and his eyes beheld a strange woman&mdash;a
beautiful, neatly-dressed young woman, with laughing, bright
eyes and rosy cheeks, and such a saucy little straw hat, so
tastily trimmed&mdash;Mrs. Morgan did that&mdash;and altogether such
a lady-like girl, that he did not recognise her, and he turned
his eyes again to the book and repeated:</p>

<p>"Thine eyes shall behold strange women&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>The book dropped from his knees to the floor, as he sprang
towards her.</p>

<p>"Am I so strange, father, that you did not know me?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my daughter, I was afraid to speak; I did not
know but a strange woman had been sent to punish me, to
'sting me like an adder.' Oh, Maggie, you don't know how
I feel that I deserve it. And yet you are so good. You are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
strange woman. It is strange, passing strange, to think that
my daughter, my little neglected, dirty, ragged, mischievous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wild Maggie, father."</p>

<p>"Yes, she had run wild; should be the lovely&mdash;you do
look lovely, Maggie&mdash;girl now in my arms. Oh, Maggie!
Maggie! this is all your work."</p>

<p>"No, no, father; you must give the good Missionary his
share of the credit; and the good people all over the country
who have sent him money and clothes to feed and clothe
the naked, and reform the drunkard. What should we have
been to-day, if he had not come to live in the Five Points,
father?"</p>

<p>"I should have been in my grave; a poor, miserable
drunkard's grave; it is awful to think where else I should
have been."</p>

<p>"Well, well, father, you are happy now,"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, and so is mother, and we shall be more so
when we get a home of our own, and all live together.
Why, Maggie, why, who did dress you up so neat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my new friend I wrote you about, Mrs. Morgan&mdash;you
got my letter&mdash;yes&mdash;well, I do wish you could see her, she is
such a good woman."</p>

<p>So they talked on, and then the old lady came up, and
then Maggie told how they had arranged it all. On Monday,
father was to see if he could find a couple of nice rooms, and
Maggie was going to see Mrs. Morgan, for Mrs. Morgan's old
uncle had told Maggie, that whenever she wanted to go to
keeping house, to come to him, she did not know what for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
but she was sure it was something good, for he was a good
man, but he never let anybody know what he did for poor
folks, he did love to do things in his own way. And Mrs.
Morgan was going to write up to the people where she lived,
and if father and mother wanted her, they would let her come
before her time was up.</p>

<p>"Your father will want you."</p>

<p>"Will you, too? Do not you want me, mother?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Maggie, I can hardly tell. Who can tell
what a day may bring forth. I am glad to see you; I have
been praying all day, that the good Spirit would direct your
steps hither to-day."</p>

<p>"Did you pray that last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;I felt it, all night, all the morning, just as
though a little stream of fire was running through me, all
over; now in my head, now, in my heart, now in my very
fingers' ends; now I started at a whisper in my ear, that
sounded just like mother, saying, 'Oh, Maggie! Oh, that
she would come! Oh, that I could see her once more!' and
then I felt as though I must come. I was afraid something
was going to happen. But now I find you all well, I see
what a foolish girl I have been."</p>

<p>"No, Maggie, not foolish, not foolish; something tells me
that you have only obeyed the dictates of a good heart, guided
by an invisible power. But we will not talk about it any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
now. I have arranged a place for you to sleep to-night, for
the house is very full, and we can scarcely find beds for those
we have, and there are applications for more poor children
every day. Do you remember that pretty little Italian beggar
girl, Madalina, that you used to go out with sometimes?
She is going to sleep in that little room, and you may sleep
with her."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, she is so dirty!"</p>

<p>"She used to be, she is not so now. She was so when she
ran the streets, just like another little girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I know who you mean, but I did not know
that she had been improved."</p>

<p>The next day, the father and mother and daughter were
sitting side by side in the chapel, and it was the remark of
more than one, "Oh, what a change!" "Is it possible that
that is old drunken Reagan and his wife, that used to live in
that Centre street cellar, and that that is 'Wild Maggie?'
What a change! Why she is real pretty, and so bright,
and so affectionate&mdash;see how she looks out the hymn for her
mother; and now they all kneel together. Well well, that is
better than all drunk together."</p>

<p>After morning service, Mrs. Reagan went into the kitchen
to assist about dinner.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell how it is," said she, "but I feel as though
this was the last meal I shall ever eat with my husband and
Maggie; perhaps I shall not eat this."</p>

<p>She never did.</p>

<p>Half an hour after that, the house was in wild commotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
"Where is Mr. Reagan?&mdash;where is Maggie?&mdash;call the doctor!&mdash;oh,
dear!&mdash;oh, dear! Mrs. Reagan is in a fit."</p>

<p>It was a fit which all must have sooner or later. Her forebodings,
from whatever cause they came, had given her prescience
of her death.</p>

<p>The husband and daughter were soon kneeling over her
where she had fallen upon the floor, vainly trying to revive
animation. The physician vainly essayed his skill.</p>

<p>"It is too late. My mother is in heaven."</p>

<p>"It is certain she is in the hands of God, and she died
with a blessing on her lips for her child," said one of the
women who were present when she fell.</p>

<p>"What did she say, Angeline?"</p>

<p>"Sally, how was it? you heard it best."</p>

<p>This is drunken Sal and old Angeline, whom you have
seen before. They, too, are inmates; sober, industrious ones,
of the House of Industry.</p>

<p>"She said, 'Oh, God, forgive me all my sins! And my
husband, forgive him, oh, Lord! as I do. Margaret, oh,
God! I thank thee for sending her to see me once more&mdash;God
bless as I do my dear Maggie. I die in peace, I die&mdash;dying&mdash;hap&mdash;Oh!'
and she fell forward; I caught her in
my arms, and laid her down gently, but she never breathed
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, mother, are you dead, dead, dead! Will
you never, never speak to your Maggie again? Oh! it is so
hard to part with you now, just as we were going to be so
happy, and all live together."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Angeline, "and that reminds me to tell you
that she said just before she died, but I thought she was talking
wild like, that if she did not see you again, that I must
tell you not to go back to Westchester, but you must be sure
to stay with your father, he would be so lonesome when she
was gone."</p>

<p>The poor husband was lonesome; he already felt it. Then
he felt what blessings he had left. He had good health and
strength, and a most affectionate good child to comfort him in
his old age. And then he poured out such a prayer, as all
ought to hear who lack courage to go on in the glorious
work of lifting up the fallen, and giving strength to the
feeble, and forgiveness to the erring. The day closed in sadness,
yet there were some who witnessed the sad scene who
felt that "it is good to be afflicted."</p>

<p>The next day after these events I was in Greenwood
Cemetery, that lovely resting-place for the dead. It is a landmark
in this progressive age, that shows the good fruits of an
improved state of society. If any of the readers of these
Life Scenes, are curious to know what becomes of the falling
leaves of this great forest of human beings, let them go over
the Brooklyn South ferry, and follow some of the score of
mourning trains that go every day to put away some dead
trunk, or lopped limb, or twig, leaf, or flower, perhaps
nothing but a bud, which they will plant in earth to blossom
in heaven; and they will see where a portion of the fallen go
to decay. It is a place for a day, not of gloom, but sweet
meditations, such as does the soul good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>I was meditating over a late made grave. It was by the
side of one almost old enough to be forgotten, and yet the
number of years since it was made were very few, and very,
very short. There was a rose bush growing at the head,
but I saw through the green leaves the name of "Morgan,
&AElig;t. 62." I was not curious to know what Morgan, for
my thoughts were far away. I did wonder, it is natural to do
so, if that was Mrs. Morgan by his side, and if they had
always lain so quiet, without words of contention, or "Caudle
Lectures." My doubts were soon to be solved, for now came
a cart and a couple of stone setters. How quick, and how
carelessly they work; now the hole is dug, now they lift the
little stone out of the cart, now they set it upright, now they
fill in the dirt around it, now they give a few stamps with
heavy boots just over the head of the sleeper&mdash;he hears them
not&mdash;now the stone is planted, now they jump into the cart,
slash the whip, and curse the poor old horse for his laziness,
and rattle away with a whistle and merry glee. Now we can
read the name on the new stone. Ah, it is not his wife&mdash;it
is "Walter Morgan, &AElig;t. 27." His son&mdash;perhaps, an only son&mdash;how
soon he has come after his father. It is a common
name, or I might moralize farther upon what I know of that
name. I am interrupted, and walk off a little way and turn
to look again. A fine, benevolent looking gentleman&mdash;faces
do look benevolent&mdash;is getting out of a carriage. He is
about the age of the elder Morgan. His brother, perhaps.
Now, he lifts out a rose bush, in bloom, in its little world, all
its own, in an earthen pot. Ah, ha! that is to be planted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the new stone just put in its place. Now he lifts out a
lovelier flower. It is a young widow. Fancy is at work
now; it says, "Is she pretty?" We are too far off to discern
features, but we can think. We do think that a widow who
comes to plant a flower at her husband's grave, is a flower of
a woman, let her face be what it may.</p>

<p>So I sat down with pencil in hand, writing, "Musings at the
Tomb." I had just written, "Benevolent old gent and beautiful
young widow," and was going to add, rose bush planted
at husband's grave, and all that sort of thing, when somebody
slapped me on the back&mdash;that knocks out the sentimental&mdash;with
a clear hearty expression of, "my old friend."</p>

<p>"Why, Lovetree, is this you? Athalia&mdash;Mrs. Morgan, I
should say."</p>

<p>"No; always call me by the name you first knew me by."</p>

<p>"Then I should call you Lucy."</p>

<p>"No, no, not that, not that."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, but I did not intend to call up unpleasant
reminiscences. Ah, what have we here? A little train of
mourners, with a tenant for that open grave. See, that is the
Missionary from the Five Points."</p>

<p>"And, oh, uncle, that is Maggie, our little Maggie from up
the country. It must be her mother. Yes, it is, for she
takes the arm of a man with a crape on his hat&mdash;it is her
father. Her mother has her wish. He will drop a tear at
her grave. See, he does; his handkerchief is at his eyes.
Oh, it is a sad thing for a husband to follow the wife he has
lived with forty years, to such an end as this. Poor Maggie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
how she weeps. I must go and see her as soon as the ceremony
is over. Suppose, uncle, that we take them in our
carriage home with us, it will not be quite so melancholy as
it will be to go back to the house of death."</p>

<p>"So we will, and then I will arrange the plan for them to
go to housekeeping together. I have already got a place in
view."</p>

<p>So they met, and so Athalia said, "Come with us."</p>

<p>And so they went. Maggie looked upon it as another
remarkable interposition, or something, at any rate, that she
could not account for, that Mrs. Morgan should have felt
impelled to come over here to-day, of all other days, and that
they should meet so singularly; "for," said she, "fifty different
parties might be riding about among these hills, and dales,
and groves, looking at this lonely poor grave, and at that
twenty thousand dollar monument, and yet no one know that
the other was so near. Well, it is a place where all must
come. I hope we shall all meet our friends as happily as I
have mine to-day."</p>

<p>So they went home with Mrs. Morgan, and three days after
they went to a house of their own.</p>

<p>You have already seen how they were able afterwards to
say to others, "Come with us," when a houseless widow and
her two children stood in the street the night of the fire&mdash;the
night that rum and its effects made Mrs. Eaton a widow.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to see the benevolent gentleman
that clothed the naked after that fire? You have seen him.
Turn back a leaf and look at him again as he lifts that rose-bush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
out of the carriage, to plant at that grave. You did not
see him in the crowd at the fire, but he was there, and heard
his prot&eacute;g&eacute; say, "Come with us." He was just going to say
it, but he liked it better that Maggie had said it first. Then
he said to himself&mdash;it was one of his odd freaks of benevolence&mdash;I
will surprise the dear girl directly, and make her remember
those golden words to her dying day.</p>

<p>You have seen him. It was Athalia's uncle.</p>

<p>Who is Athalia?</p>

<p>Turn over. Read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">ATHALIA, THE SEWING GIRL.</p>

<blockquote><p>"How full of briars is this working day world."</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With fingers weary and worn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With eyelids heavy and red,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A woman sat in unwomanly rags,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Plying her needle and thread."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Athalia wore not unwomanly rags at the period when I
shall commence her history. She was clad in the garb of a
country girl, just arrived in the city, in the full expectation
that fortune awaited her, just as soon as she could learn the
trade of a dress-maker. Oh, how she worked, and laughed,
and sung! She was the life of the shop. Sometimes she
thought of home&mdash;home where mother was&mdash;and then she
wept. But the sunshine of youth soon sends the clouds and
dew drops that dim the eye away to forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Athalia was sixteen&mdash;sweet sixteen in face and mind.
What a bright blue eye, what soft brown hair, what wit, and
oh, what a voice in song! and such a heart, 'twas tuned for
others' woes, and not her own.</p>

<p>Why comes this mountain flower from her country home?</p>

<p>Her father was a farmer&mdash;ah! <i>was</i>&mdash;would be still, only
that he had swallowed his farm. The mortgage to the store at
the cross roads, the damage paid in a law suit for a fight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the cost of throwing his neighbor's horse down his well, had
left him without a home for himself, and so his children went
forth into the world to seek bread; the daughter, of course,
by the needle, the sons at sea.</p>

<p>Athalia chose the city. How little she knew the danger.
She would have shuddered to see a man sit carelessly down
upon a powder keg with a pipe in his mouth. Not half so
dangerous is that, as for a young country girl, with a beautiful
face, to come here.</p>

<p>Oh, how she worked one whole year to learn her dress-maker's
trade, without one cent of compensation. Such is the
law. The law of custom with milliners' apprentices.</p>

<p>Then she went home. How joyfully her mother opened
her arms; how sweet was that kiss&mdash;a loved mother's kiss.
Did she love her father? How could she love a man who
often cursed, and sometimes beat that mother? She went
home to stay, to ply her new trade among her old neighbors.
How could she love her father when he would not let her stay,
and, like a drunken brute as he was, drove her back again to
the city?</p>

<p>"You have learnt a city trade, and you have got city airs;
nobody wants you here."</p>

<p>It was not so. Everybody wanted her there but her miserable
father. Everybody else loved Athalia. They saw no
city airs; all they saw was that a rough diamond had been
polished. What is it worth without?</p>

<p>So she came back to the city with a heavy heart. What
was she to do? She could go back to her old shop and work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
eighteen hours a day, for twenty-five cents, and scanty food;
lodging, as she had done during her long year of apprenticeship,
three in a narrow bed, in a room with just air and space
enough for the decent accommodation of a cat, nothing more.
What hope in such a life? What would she have at the end
of the year? Just what she had at the beginning? No; for
one year of youth would be gone.</p>

<p>She could not go back; there was no hope there. So, with
another girl just as poor, but just as willing to work, she took
a room, and took in work, or went out to do it. Then how
she was exposed, how in danger. Libertines live in genteel
families. Ah, and are pet sons of mothers who would give
dollars to dissipated rakes, and grudge shillings to poor dress-makers.
And if the poor girl should be caught in the snare
of such a son, how the mother would rave and drive her away
unpaid, because she had disgraced her "respectable boy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan was one of Athalia's lady "patrons." Haughtily
proud, yet not, like some of her class, positively dishonest,
cruelly dishonest. She wanted the labor of the poor sewing
girl, because she possessed great taste, and could dress her
daughters better, and what was still more, though so little
practised by the rich, cheaper, than she could get their dresses
at a "regular establishment." That was just what the daughters
most disliked. They knew that none of their acquaintances
wore such neat-fitting dresses, but when the question
was put, "Where did you get them made?" they could not
answer, "Oh, we always get everything at Madame Chalambeau's
fashionable establishment in Broadway."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>They could not change their mother's policy, and so they
determined to drive poor Athalia out of the house.</p>

<p>They had another object. Athalia was beautiful. Her
face was such as we are apt to conceive that an angel must
have. And everybody who came in the house while she was
there, and saw her, said, "Oh, what a sweet face!"</p>

<p>This was gall and wormwood to the "young ladies," for
their faces were just such as you would suppose were made
out of those two ingredients, and they were true indications
of their minds. So they hated the poor seamstress for double
cause.</p>

<p>At first she came to the table with the family. But the
girls could not help observing that she was the diamond, they
the setting, to all eyes. She was better bred than they, with
all their boarding-school education. Where had she got it?
In a country school house, and her mother's kitchen.</p>

<p>Once, once only, after tea she was invited to sing. Who
supposed that she could touch a piano note. She accepted
the invitation, as all well-bred girls do, who know that they
can sing, and Walter offered his arm to lead her to the piano.</p>

<p>Walter was the brother, the only "son and heir of our
family." He had just returned from a lady-killing Niagara
tour, and met Athalia for the first time at the tea table. It
was the last time, the sisters said, that he should meet her
there. She went home that evening; she had finished her job
and received her poor pay. That was one of Mrs. Morgan's
virtues; she paid the stipulated price to those who worked for
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>What daggers, scorpions' stings, and poisoned darts, poor
Athalia and Walter would have felt, while he stood over her
at the piano, if they could have felt the glances of scornful,
angry eyes. How he was taken to task afterwards for paying
attention to "a sewing girl," particularly for waiting upon her
home.</p>

<p>How he justified himself. Just as though there was need
of it. But aristocracy had stept down to the level of one who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Plied her needle and thread,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In poverty, hunger, and toil;"<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who sang with a voice of saddening song,<br></span>

</div></div>

<p>Walter justified, apologised, for he was bound in the iron
fetters, "polite custom."</p>

<p>"I found," says he, "when I came home, a beautiful, well-dressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
well-behaved girl, to all appearance a young lady, at
your tea table."</p>

<p>"Well, she shall never come there again. I always told
mother that she might know better than to bring her to the
table; and the pert minx, if she knew her place, would never
try to stick herself into genteel company. So much for
having a dress-maker in the house."</p>

<p>"Elsie, Elsie, I am ashamed of you."</p>

<p>"I think you had better be ashamed of yourself, mother."</p>

<p>"I found her," resumed Walter, "at your table, and I took
the only vacant seat, by her side. I did not find her pert,
but on the contrary, I must say it, better behaved, better
spoken, than my sister Elsie, when speaking of or to her
mother."</p>

<p>"You had better insult me, by your comparison, Sir
Walter."</p>

<p>"No; I do not intend that. But I was only explaining
why I paid attention to the lady."</p>

<p>"The lady&mdash;lady! That to a sewing girl who goes out to
work by day's work. Did you learn that at college or at
Saratoga?"</p>

<p>"I have learned to call every female lady, who looks, acts,
and talks like one. I hope my sister Elsie will not unlearn
me. I found the lady at your table. I found her polite and
diffident. She is not a forward minx. I walked with her to
the parlor."</p>

<p>"Yes, and she should have known better than to go there.
Why did she not go back to her work?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Elsie, she had done her work, and was waiting for your
father to come home, so I could get some money to pay her;
for I should be ashamed to keep her out of her money, or
oblige her to call again. You had spent all the change I had
in the house in your afternoon shopping. It was me that asked
her to stay. It was me that asked her into the parlor. It
was me, your mother, that asked her to sing one of those
plaintive, sweet songs, I had heard her sing to the children
while at work. It was you that urged her. What for? That
she might fail. Elsie, Elsie, there is envy in your heart."</p>

<p>"And she did sing. Was ever anything sweeter? I can
repeat every word, for every note went down into my soul,
and printed itself like the magnetic telegraph. Listen:</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"Smitten&mdash;smitten&mdash;my brother Walter smitten with my
dress-maker! Faugh! I wonder if he went home with her,
for he went out at the same time?"</p>

<p>Yes, he did go home with her. It was her first false step.
But ye that stand fast, do not censure this first step of her
fall. She was young and handsome; so was he. Theirs were
such hearts as nature sports with. Both were touched. He
went home with her. They got into a stage at Seventeenth
street to ride to Broome, for there was the home of the sewing
girl. At Broome street he forgot to pull the check string.
She did not notice it till the crowd of cars, carriages, and
swarms of human beings, which fill up that great wide
thoroughfare, Canal street, awakened her, from her reverie of
wild thoughts, to the fact that they were already too far
down. Before he could stop her she had pulled the string,
and the driver held up and looked down through his little
peep hole at his passengers, ready for his sixpenny fare, which
he will contrive to make seven cents, if he makes change for
you.</p>

<p>Walter acknowledged that he did not mean to stop the
stage; he wanted Athalia to go to Taylor's, and take an ice
cream with him. But she was inexorable. He plead, she
said, no; she said it sweetly, and, finally, they compromised by
her agreeing to go to-morrow evening.</p>

<p>The second false step!</p>

<p>Then he walked home with her. She said, good night, at
the door, he said, "Oh, let me see you up these dim stairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I am used to them, I can find my room in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
dark. If Jeannette is at home, she will hear a little signal
upon the wall, and open the door, then it will be light."</p>

<p>"Give it then."</p>

<p>She did; Jeannette was not at home.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me go up, and just look in, and see where angels
live."</p>

<p>Oh, flattery! thy power is great. Why should she
refuse, since he was to come again, she had promised that?
So she said, "come up, then," and away she tripped into the
darkness, her step so light that he could not tell where it fell.
Directly there was a little scratch, a flash, a blue flame, very
small, and then a full white light, and a match, and then a
lamp was burning.</p>

<p>"Come up. Take care of the narrow, crooked steps, they
are not like your broad easy stair-case."</p>

<p>She had made another false step. Did far off visions of
fancy revel in her brain, that she might some day go up that
broad stair-case, arm in arm with that handsome young man?
What if they did? you too have dreamed more unlikely day
dreams.</p>

<p>"Come up, can you see?"</p>

<p>Yes, he could see,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By the lamp dimly burning,"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>just up there above him, one of the houris he had often read
of, often dreamed of, never before seen. He went up, to her
little heaven of a room. How could she sing that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Commerce wears an ugly frown,"<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></div></div>

<p>while everything looked so smiling in her mart? How could
she long for the sweet seclusion of her country home, with
such a bijou of a hermit's cell here? He stood amazed. He
spoke not, but he thought. Did she divine his thoughts?&mdash;she
answered them&mdash;how did she know them? The magnetic
telegraph of the soul was at work.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we are obliged to keep our room neat, because
ladies come here to get work done, and they would not give
us their custom if we lived in a plain room."</p>

<p>Plain room! What would his sisters say to a plainly furnished
room, if that was not one?</p>

<p>"True, it is plainer than theirs&mdash;I mean&mdash;but you did not
speak&mdash;I thought you spoke&mdash;yes it is plain compared with
rooms that ladies occupy. We pay enough though for the
furniture to have good."</p>

<p>"Do you hire it then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we neither of us had money enough to furnish a
room, only a few things, and pay the rent in advance. So we
hired a furniture man to put in the things, and we pay him
for the use of them."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Five dollars a month."</p>

<p>"Five dollars! Why there is not over a hundred dollars
worth."</p>

<p>"No, sir; that is just what it was counted at. They are
all second-hand articles. There is the bedstead; we furnished
the bed and bedding; my mother gave me that; Jeannette
has no mother; and the table, and the other little pine table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the bureau, the wash-stand, the six chairs, the rocker, and the
sofa; we made those ottomans, and the curtains; and in that
pantry&mdash;&mdash;. Oh, I declare how I am running on."</p>

<p>"Pray, tell me, Miss&mdash;&mdash;, I really have not learned your
name yet."</p>

<p>"Athalia. I am sure you heard your mother call me
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I was going to call you by your sirname."</p>

<p>"Lovetree, sir. Athalia Lovetree."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a very sweet, pretty name."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, so much so that I think I shall always keep it."</p>

<p>"So all the young ladies say. But it hardly ever proves
true with one who owns so pretty a name, and a face prettier
still."</p>

<p>More flattery. She did not hear it. No. She felt it
though.</p>

<p>"Well, I am very sure I never shall change my first name.
I never shall be called by any other than Athalia."</p>

<p>She thought so then; I wonder if she ever thought of it in
after years?</p>

<p>"But you have not told me what is in that pantry."</p>

<p>"Oh, no matter; that is where we keep all our dishes and
cooking utensils. We have a stove in winter; in summer, a
little charcoal furnace behind the fire-board."</p>

<p>"And is your room warm in winter?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, sir, if we have plenty of work."</p>

<p>"Does work keep you warm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; but work gives us money to buy coal. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was a time last winter, when we were out of work,
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You had no fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but only a few days, we had to make up the
month's rent, eight dollars for the room, and five for the furniture."</p>

<p>Walter put his hand in his pocket. What for? He felt
how easy it would be to take out a hundred dollars, and tell
her, to go and pay for that furniture, and not pay rent for it
any longer. Then he thought how ridiculous, to be so
affected by the woes and wants of a sewing girl. How his
proud sisters would laugh at him. Pride conquered a heart
prone to a good action.</p>

<p>"And so you went without fire, to pay that usurious old
miser who owns this furniture, sixty per cent per annum, for
the use of it. Sixty, yes, more than a hundred upon what it
would sell for at auction. And what did you do for food in
the meantime?"</p>

<p>"Well, we did not need much, and should not have suffered
any, if Mrs. Jenkins had paid me for my work. Oh, if
she only knew how much we did need it. Jeannette was
sick, and what little money I had, I spent for her; I had
almost ten dollars due me for work, and could not get one.
It is wicked to keep poor girls out of their money; indeed it
is, when they are sick and suffering for it."</p>

<p>"And you suffered, while Mrs. Jenkins, with her thirteen
servants, and coach and horses owed you for work?"</p>

<p>"Well, we did not suffer much, except I had to pawn my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
black silk dress, the very one too that I needed most when it
was cold, and had to do without fire when Jeannette was
sick, and should, by all means, have had one. She is a sweet,
good girl; I wish she was at home."</p>

<p>"Wish again, and you will see her."</p>

<p>Both started as though caught in something they were
ashamed of. Why should they be? True he had approached
very close to Athalia, as she stood watering her flowers and
feeding her bird&mdash;both windows were full of flowers, and over
each a canary bird; and he was watching all her operations
with as much interest as though they were all his own.</p>

<p>"Poor things," she said, "they look neglected."</p>

<p>She loved flowers. So did he. He loved their owner, but
he had not said so yet. He hardly knew it; he would not
let any one know it; hence he started when Jeannette spoke,
for he thought she must have seen it. He blushed and turned
round, and then she blushed; there was a trio of blushes.
What for? Jeannette did not think it was a stranger. She
thought it was Charley Vail. Charley was a sort of beau, yet
not a beau. He was Jeannette's cousin; and though he did
not love her exactly, he liked her, and I guess that she liked
him; Athalia thought more than liked him. Charley would
have loved Athalia if she had given him the least encouragement,
but she would not, for she hoped he would love his
cousin and marry her. He was a good fellow, always ready
to do anything on earth for "the girls"&mdash;in short he was
Charley.</p>

<p>Jeannette blushed. She had reason to, for, thinking it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was cousin Charley&mdash;who else could it be, there in their
room alone with Athalia, in the evening&mdash;she tripped up
behind him and gave him a good hearty slap on the back.
He turned around, she almost felt him hugging and kissing
her, but he did not. She looked again, the light now
shone in his face, and there she stood before a stranger. Is
it any wonder she blushed? is it any wonder he blushed? is
it any wonder they all blushed? She played with her bonnet
strings; he twirled his hat; Athalia could not play with any
thing. She had the lamp in one hand, and the bird cage in
the other. But she could laugh, and she burst out in such
clear, musical tones, as she said, "Why, Jeannette, did you
think it was Charley?"</p>

<p>That explained the whole. He understood the blow now.
Did he also understand what Charley would have done, if it
had been him that got the blow. Perhaps he thought, for
he said, "You have struck me, miss. I never take a blow without
giving one back. There."</p>

<p>Did he strike her? What! strike a woman! Shame!
Oh, no; but he caught her in his arms, before she could be
aware of the movement, and such a kiss! such, a good, hearty
kiss as he gave her. Ah, well! who would not? She was a
nice, sweet girl, not quite so pretty as Athalia, but one that a
colder heart than his might relish in just such a case. She
pouted a little, and talked about great liberty in a stranger;
but who took the first liberty? True; but "that was a mistake."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then count the other a mistake too."</p>

<p>"No, that was done on purpose."</p>

<p>"So it was, and I should like to do it again, but I will not,
so rudely. Pray forgive me."</p>

<p>What had she to forgive? what to be angry about. How
could she hold out against that, "I should like to do it again?"</p>

<p>After all she was not half so angry as Athalia. And what
was she angry about? That he had kissed Jeannette instead
of her? Take care, little heart, jealousy is creeping in among
thy pulsations. Take care, big heart, for just now Charley
enters the scene, and before he has observed that a stranger
is in the room, he has kissed Athalia.</p>

<p>Mischief has broke loose to-night. What is in the men?
What is in Walter Morgan, that a kiss given to that girl, for
the first time seen that night, should send a pang to his heart?
How it goes throbbing through every nerve, and pricks into
the very core of sensation. Take care, big heart and little
heart, nature is at her sports and she always makes pleasures
sweet by contrast with pain.</p>

<p>Finally, all are reconciled. How they do laugh over the
queer mistakes. Jeannette would have sooner struck a bear
than him, yet he did not bite her. Charley would have sooner
kissed that same bear, and risked the hug, than have kissed
Athalia before a stranger, for he is a good boy, a little mischievous,
but would never do a thing to hurt the feelings of
another, particularly a woman.</p>

<p>How they did sit, and talk, and laugh, and enjoy happiness,
such as Walter had never found in rose-wood furnished parlors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
What would his proud sisters say, if they knew how "low he
had sunk himself, to keep company with sewing girls?" But
he would not tell them. Take care, young man, you are
breaking in upon the conventionalities of life. You must
stick to your <i>caste</i>, in America as well as India. You may
lay your heart at the feet of anything that is old and ugly,
even as your sisters, so that she is <i>ton</i> and of the <i>ton</i>&mdash;the
upper <i>ton</i>. But offer to love one who lives, barely lives, by
her needle, and see how your own flesh and blood will hate
you.</p>

<p>So passed the evening away. Then Walter would go. But
he wanted to hear Athalia sing once more. No. She had no
piano. His hand was in his pocket again. How he would
like to send her one to-morrow, but he dared not say so. He
did look around the room, to see where he could set it. There
was no room. She could not sing any more to-night. Ask
Jeannette. She sings a beautiful little song while we are at
work. No, she could not. She was afraid to sing before
strangers. But Charley asked her, in his blandest manner, and
then she would sing one verse if he would go right home.
How anxious she was to get rid of him. So she sung:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why bitter life with useless tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With mourning unavailing?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Why bitter hope with ceaseless fears,<br></span>

<span class="i0">With lively song and music peals,<br></span>

<span class="i8">Motion, motion, motion.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To toss us with its motion."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There now, I hope you are satisfied. If not you may go,
for I shall not sing another word to-night. I don't know how
I came to do that."</p>

<p>No, they were not satisfied. Who ever knew a man that
was? Who ever got one favor of a woman, that did not ask
for two more? So they both asked both the girls to go to
the theatre to-morrow night, and both promised.</p>

<p>More false steps. How many will it take to reach the end?</p>

<p>Walter went home, never more happy. You have seen
how he was taken to task. He had defied the laws of caste.</p>

<p>It did not require stronger Argus eyes than his two sisters
possessed to see how deeply he was enamored with Athalia.
How they did wish they knew whether she had dared to
look up to him, as he had down to her. How should they
find out. It does not take mischief-makers long to contrive
their plot. If one woman wants to ruin another one, there
is one always ready to assist her in her wicked design. No
doubt he was the father of millinery, for he caused the first
apron to be made, and he has assisted largely in all the
designs of female apparel from that day to this. Sometimes
his fashion is very fig-leafish, barely hiding a portion of the
body, while the limbs, head, neck, shoulders, and other
"excitements," are left exposed to Adam's rude gaze. Then
he contrives his fashion of so much cloth, that those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
follow it may lose their souls in its attainment, and those
who make them may feel, as they</p>

<p>Mischief is always busy. It must be so with an envious
wicked woman.</p>

<p>The Morgans changed their tactics, and adopted those
more wicked than I could invent.</p>

<p>They soon found that they wanted more dresses, and what
was very remarkable, they did not want to go to the French
dress-maker. What could be the reason? They had watched
their brother; they had seen him go to Athalia's; they had
seen him in the theatre with her; they had met them walking,
arm in arm, in Broadway, "the shameless hussey;" and
once they had entered Thompson's, and walked upstairs to
take ice cream, "actually over our heads." Walter Morgan,
the richest merchant's son, in New York, gallanting a seamstress&mdash;their
own dress-maker. And every day some of their
acquaintance were asking them, "Who is that beautiful girl
I saw with Walter?" Of course they did not know; how
could they tell that he had taken up with "such a thing?"
In vain they talk to him, he was mum, or if he spoke of her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it was with the highest respect. Would he marry her?
Ah, there was the rub.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," said Elsie, "that he would not ruin her, and
that would be the end of it."</p>

<p>Did a spirit furnish that cue, or was it a wicked woman's
own conceit? At any rate, it was a cue upon which they
acted. Athalia was sent for, and the young ladies never
were so affable before. Every opportunity was contrived for
Walter to accomplish the purpose of a villain. Their
schemes had the exact contrary effect desired. He had
made such advances at first as "men about town" do make,
and had met with such a decided repulse, not an angry one,
but a virtuous one, that he never would try again.</p>

<p>"I expected it," said she to his proposals, "I am used to it&mdash;I
am almost every day exposed to such tempting offers,
to escape a life of poverty&mdash;I have ceased to look upon them
as insulting&mdash;nature, and fashion, and the state of society, are
such in this city, that a girl with an unfortunate face like
mine, must fall, unless she is possessed of such fortitude as
but few young girls are naturally gifted with. You may ask
me that question every day; every day you may, if you feel
like wounding the feelings of a poor girl, repeat your question,
and every day you will get the same answer."</p>

<p>"Athalia, forgive me. Oh, forgive me; I never will repeat
the question again; whether you forgive me or not, you need
have no fear of that."</p>

<p>What a failure then had his sisters made. They did just
what they did not intend to do; they led Walter to think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that his family would approve a match with one so virtuous,
so beautiful, so lovely, even if she was a sewing girl, and he
began to build castles in the air upon this foundation. They
were very sandy, and a storm was approaching that would
soon beat upon the frail walls, and like all such fabrics, down
they will tumble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Marriage, death, bankruptcy, poverty, sin, and, finally,
"plucked like a brand from the burning," are the contents,
the introduction, and peroration, of this chapter. If you are
satisfied at a glance, you can pass on, the filling up, is but the
shading of the sketch. But if you are curious to know who
marries, who dies, and who does worse&mdash;read.</p>

<p>"It is but a step from the palace to the tomb," yet the
road sometimes seems a long and dreary one, leading through
strange, dark places.</p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion, that lovers of romance, and
those who cater for them, writing tales of fiction, have
mistaken their vocation. Let them gather up and detail a
few of the incidents of real Life Scenes as they occur, and
there will be no occasion for fiction. So let us on with our
narration of events.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan was a merchant, wealthy as Cr&oelig;sus, perhaps
more so; and he had more need to be, for he lived "up town,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in "up town" style. The simple interest upon the cost of his
house and furniture was seven thousand dollars a year, and
his annual expenses double that sum.</p>

<p>Of course his daughters had never taken a stitch in their
lives. They had been to school, where nothing useful is taught;
and learned what is called music, and could waltz to perfection.
Walter, had been to college. What had he learnt?
To drink a bottle of wine every day after dinner, and "fill up,"
with mint juleps, sherry coblers, and brandy smashes, the
intermediate time. Not one useful thing had either of them
been taught, not one lesson in the art of self-support; all was
self-indulgence. They laughed, or would have laughed at the
idea, if any one had dared to mention it, that the time would
ever come, that they would have occasion to lift a hand to
procure their own bread.</p>

<p>It is a bad school&mdash;it has many scholars.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan came home one day in unusual glee; he was
naturally a stern man. He had heard of the very successful
voyage of the Matilda&mdash;named after his daughter&mdash;to China,
where she would load with teas and silks for a home voyage.
She was insured in a very rich London office. Some of his
cautious friends advised him to "hedge," by insuring also in
other offices; he had never met with a single loss in his life;
he had often been his own insurer, and took about half the
value of the Matilda now on his own insurance book, which
showed a great many thousand dollars in his favor.</p>

<p>"Yes," said a Paul Pry, of my acquaintance, "more thousands
than he is now worth, if his debts were paid."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Who believed it? Not the banks, which loaned him any
amount he desired. Not the wife, and son, and daughters, for
that stern husband and father never told them of his business.</p>

<p>"That is my business," was the cut-off valve which always
shut down upon every question as certain as that of the steam
engine at the point where it must change the motion.</p>

<p>After dinner and the second bottle, the family were startled
by the sudden announcement he made for to-morrow.</p>

<p>"We start for Lake George to-morrow morning; come, get
ready."</p>

<p>"Why, father, what has started you all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>"That's my business."</p>

<p>"Well, we cannot get ready, no way in the world."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I could get a ship ready before ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"But we cannot get new hats."</p>

<p>"Plenty of time. Start right out."</p>

<p>"To-night? Buy a hat in the evening, who ever heard of
such a thing? What would Mrs. Grundy say?"</p>

<p>"Ask her, she is going with us; or rather, we are going
with them. Grundy is in shoal water, and wants to get out
of sight a few days; and I want he should, for I am on his
paper heavy."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is absolutely impossible for us to go to our milliner
to-night."</p>

<p>"Go in the morning, then. Time enough."</p>

<p>"What? before ten o'clock. How vulgar you are, father."</p>

<p>"Very well: if you cannot get up new flying gibs, go to
sea with the old ones."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I suppose we might send for Madam Pantanosi to
call in the morning; but, dear me, there are our dresses all in
the work-room, not one of them done. You don't expect
Athalia is going to finish them to-night, do you?"</p>

<p>"Have you no others?"</p>

<p>"What if we have? the Grundys know that we have new
ones making, and of course, will expect to see them. You
don't expect your daughters, I hope, to wear old dresses, on a
tour to the Lakes?"</p>

<p>"Why not? That is the place to wear them."</p>

<p>"You may talk, father, but it is out of the question."</p>

<p>"Well, settle it your own way. I go to-morrow, and if
you are going with me, you had better be getting ready;
besides, let me tell you, young Wendall is going up too.
We are going to have some great sport, fishing."</p>

<p>That decided Elsie. If George Wendall and the Grundys
were going, she must go, for he and Minnie Grundy needed
watching. She would go, if she wore the old hat, and a dress
that had been worn twice before.</p>

<p>"Where is that seamstress? she must work all night, and
get my dress done any way."</p>

<p>"Elsie, daughter, she cannot do that, her eyes are very
weak. You had better take her along with us, the poor girl;
give her a little country air, and let her finish your dresses
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that's it, wife, let her go along. She appears to
be a right, tight little craft. A sail will do her good. What
a pity she did not hail from the right port."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have very curious notions, father."</p>

<p>"That is my business."</p>

<p>"Well, for my part," says Matilda, "I think she can go
just as well as not; our maid and she can have a room
together, and nobody need to know that we have brought
a seamstress along with us; if they did, they would think it
very vulgar. Of course, she won't come to the table with us,
at the hotel."</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I guess she will not; though, I suppose, we
shall have a private table; shall we not, father?"</p>

<p>"That is my business."</p>

<p>But as it was settled that she was to go, it was, finally,
thought necessary to tell her so, and she was sent for, and
told of the arrangement.</p>

<p>How could she go? How start so sudden? How leave
Jeannette? She could not go. Yet she would like to.
Perhaps she never would have another opportunity. She
would go down and see Jeannette, and if she could go, she
would come up very early. Away she ran upstairs for her
little straw hat and black mantilla. Walter had been a
"silent member" of the party. What wild thoughts ran
through his brain, when he found that Athalia was to be one
of the party. Did he dream of the shady walk, the moonlit
lake, and egg-shell boat, with only two in it, floating upon
the glassy surface of the water? Did he think that he
should climb the rocks with her, and wander through the
ruins of old Ticonderoga? Yes, he did dream; youth do
dream. Did she dream, while she stood before the glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
tying her bonnet strings? What of? Of the hook that he
would bait and put in her hands, and the fish that would be
caught. Fish! It is not fish alone that young girls catch,
when young men bait hooks for them, in wild woods, and
lonely glens, where mountain streams murmur soft music.</p>

<p>As she came down upon the steps, Walter was waiting
there. What for? For a poor sewing girl. He wanted, he
said, that she should stop with him and pick out a hat and
some little articles, a toilet box, and sundry conveniences or
necessaries, to one on a journey, for his sister Matilda.</p>

<p>Oh yes, she would do that, with pleasure, if he wished it.
He did wish it. The selections were made with great taste
and without regard to expense. The hat was a little treasure.</p>

<p>What was that sigh for? Can a woman&mdash;a young girl&mdash;just
on the eve, too, of a journey to a watering place, see such
a hat shut up in its paper case, without a sigh? It is more
than human nature ever could do. Athalia is human, and
that hat is just such a one as she would like herself. She is
too poor. So she sighed and went home.</p>

<p>"Shall I send it?"</p>

<p>"Let it be until I return, and then I will give directions."</p>

<p>It is no matter what Walter said to her on the way home,
but she had determined to go with the Morgans, to Lake
George, and so she told him.</p>

<p>"Good night then, I must go home and get ready, you
know what the word is with father&mdash;'that is my business.'"</p>

<p>He had a little other business. He went back to the store,
and gave the necessary orders about the purchase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would the lady be kind enough to write a little note that
he would dictate, and put it in the bonnet box?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, anything to oblige the gentleman. Was that
his sister? His cousin perhaps? Well, she is very pretty, at
any rate. Was that her name? What a sweet name."</p>

<p>What sweet words to Walter. How we do like to hear
those we love spoken of in such words.</p>

<p>How Athalia busied herself getting her few things ready.
What she lacked, Jeannette, the good soul, lent her. She
never thought how lonely the room would be for the two or
three weeks she would be away.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a few dollars to spare, Jeannette, I certainly
would go and buy just such a hat as I picked out this evening
for Matilda Morgan. It was very pretty. And Walter, he
admired it too. He said it was so tasty, when I tried it on,
to let him see how it looked."</p>

<p>Just then there was a rap at the door.</p>

<p>"Oh there comes cousin Charley."</p>

<p>No, it could not be Charley, it was a little rap. The door
was opened, and there stood a little girl with a bandbox and
bundle.&mdash;It is a shame to send such little girls out late in the
evening with such heavy bundles.</p>

<p>"Does Miss Lovetree live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then this is the place."</p>

<p>"Oh dear," says Jeannette, "more work. Who can this be
from? Why, Athalia, what is the matter, you look amazed?"</p>

<p>"I am amazed. Is there no mistake in the direction?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it is Miss Athalia Lovetree. No.&mdash;Broome street,
up-stairs."</p>

<p>"Oh! I cannot take it, indeed I cannot. Accept such a
present from him? No, no, no."</p>

<p>He had thought of that. Jeannette by this time had
the bandbox open. Did woman ever resist that temptation?</p>

<p>"Ah here is a note. This will explain the mystery."</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">To Miss Lovetree</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As it is decided that you will go with us to Lake George, please
accept a few things that you will need, which I have commissioned my
son to buy.</p>

<p>"From your friend,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Morgan.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Oh that is a different thing, if they come from her. And
then for him to pretend all the time that they were for his
sister. It is too bad. Oh, but it is a love of a hat though! is
it not, Jeannette?"</p>

<p>Yes, it was; that was settled. First one tried it on, and
then the other. Jeannette said it was a <i>bride's</i> hat. Athalia
said she ought to be ashamed of herself to say so. Then all
the other little bijouterie were overhauled, and looked at,
and talked over, and praised, and then the note was read again,
and the postscript; there was a postscript, there always is a
postscript to a woman's letter. It was the postscript that gave
it the air of genuineness. It read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"P. S.&mdash;Don't say a word to me, or hint where the hat came from,
for I don't want Mr. Morgan or the girls ever to know; nobody knows
but Walter."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>No, nobody knows but Walter. There was no fiction in
that.</p>

<p>In the morning there was another rap&mdash;louder this time.
It did not disturb any sleep though; there had been none in
that room that night. It was John, come for the trunk and
bandbox&mdash;two things that a modern lady never travels without.
There was a wagon load of them left the Morgan and
Grundy mansions that morning, and they and their owners
all arrived, in due course of cars and locomotives, at Lake
George.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan and George Wendall fished, the girls flirted,
Athalia sewed and sighed, and walked out evenings, slyly,
with Walter Morgan.</p>

<p>More false steps. Sly walks in town are bad&mdash;in the country,
dangerous. There are a great many precipices, down
which such a couple may tumble.</p>

<p>George was a glorious fishing companion for the shipping
merchant. He could row and drive, and get up all the fixings;
and, after dinner, talk, and laugh, and drink, till both went to
bed "glorious."</p>

<p>"Mr. Morgan, you drink one bottle too many."</p>

<p>"Pshaw. What if I do? that is my business."</p>

<p>It is sometimes the wife's business.</p>

<p>George was a boon companion, that was all. He had
nothing, did nothing, lived somehow, dressed well&mdash;ill-natured
folks said he did not pay his tailor.</p>

<p>Who ever thought that he would be Mr. Morgan's son-in-law?
He did, and so had his daughter, Elsie, lately concluded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
for the country air and scenery are provocatives to that
end.</p>

<p>"Ask father."</p>

<p>"Enough said."</p>

<p>He did. He took care to ask him just at the right time.</p>

<p>"Why, George, my boy, good fellow to fish. Did not
think you had your hook there. Got any bait? No. Well
I have. Enough for both of us. I will bait your hook, boy.
That is my business."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. When shall it be?"</p>

<p>George knew the art of fishing with a fresh bait, and never
losing sight of the fish after he had tasted it, until he had him
safe bagged.</p>

<p>"When shall it be? Now, now&mdash;right off to-night.
Nothing like going to sea while the tide serves."</p>

<p>He was a prompt man always. It was no use to say no,
after he had said yes, or, "that is my business;" so in half an
hour after that, Elsie Morgan was Elsie Wendall.</p>

<p>Of course more wine was drank, after which a letter was
brought to him, from his head clerk, marked, "Important&mdash;in
haste." So Mrs. Morgan told him.</p>

<p>"That is my business; take it up to my room. Do you
think I am going to read the stupid letters of old Precision
at this time of the evening, and my daughter just married?"</p>

<p>At ten o'clock next morning, after the mail had gone, he
read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sir:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have advices by telegraph from London, just as the steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was leaving port, of the failure of the London insurance office, in
Which the Matilda is insured. She is now over-due, and not yet
reported. Shall I insure her? Be sure to answer by first mail.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">James Precision.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>How the bell did ring; how he stamped, and swore, and
wrote, and yet he could not send his letter till next morning.</p>

<p>"Why did not old Precision insure at once? Every dollar
on earth would be swallowed up if that ship were lost."</p>

<p>Simply because he was Precision, and the merchant, who
had directed him for forty years, had never given him leave to
act, upon his own discretion, in an emergency like this.</p>

<p>"That is my business," was the unvarying answer.</p>

<p>Two days after, he had another letter from his precise clerk.
He did not order it up to his room, to wait till next morning,
for he was in a tearing passion when it was handed him; and
he felt as though he would have opened it if the biggest rocks
in that mountainous region had been piled upon it.</p>

<p>What had so disturbed the rich merchant? Those who have
them not, are apt to fancy that, riches and happiness are
handmaids. What was the matter? His son, his only son,
had just approached him, taking advantage, as Wendall had,
of a propitious hour, when wine had done its work&mdash;he drank
brandy since the news in that letter, and that fired, not soothed
him&mdash;he approached him with a beautiful sweet girl upon his
arm, to ask his consent to their marriage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wendall screamed and fainted&mdash;that is, in appearance.</p>

<p>Matilda said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Walter! to that girl&mdash;marry that thing&mdash;a dressmaker"</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan simply said, "Walter, you have disgraced
yourself and the mother that bore you. And I never wish to
see you again."</p>

<p>Athalia trembled and quailed before the storm of angry
words and envenomed looks that surrounded her. How gladly
would she have escaped. It was too late.</p>

<p>"Father, your consent."</p>

<p>"Never! You, my only son, marry a common sewing
girl, never."</p>

<p>"It is too late. Here is my marriage certificate."</p>

<p>His father opened his mouth to curse him. What for?
He had married a girl he loved&mdash;a girl, handsome, virtuous,
industrious, but poor&mdash;a seamstress.</p>

<p>"A letter, sir;" said a servant.</p>

<p>"Give it me."</p>

<p>He tore it open and read;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yours of the 12th inst. came too late. News reached the city an
hour before that the Matilda was&mdash;&mdash;"</p></blockquote>

<p>He did not say lost. He looked it. He looked at his son
and his poor trembling little wife, as though he wished them
both at the bottom of the sea, with the Matilda and her
cargo&mdash;all his fortune! He felt all the envenomed bitterness
that a violent natural temper can feel, when heated and inflamed
by drunkenness; for he was drunk, fashionably drunk;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
but not so much so but he could feel how irretrievably ruined
he was, and that the failure to insure was occasioned by
drunkenness, such drunkenness as the highest class of society
indulge in, when they take an "extra bottle," after dinner,
upon extraordinary occasions. He knew the fault was all
his own. He had said, when urged to open the letter,
an answer to which would have saved all, "that is my
business."</p>

<p>It was a sad, sad business. That one more bottle had
beggared himself, and all that were dependant upon him. He
had just married one daughter to a man whose only qualification
was "a good fellow," who could shoot, fish, smoke, drink,
drive fast horses, cheat his tailor, and the poor widow boarding-house
keeper, and, finally, take advantage of a besotted old
rich merchant, when he had drunk just to the point of good-nature&mdash;when
the indulger in strong drink feels like hugging
everybody and "all the rest of mankind,"&mdash;to get his consent
for him to marry his ugly daughter. It was a marriage of
convenience, the obligations of which he intended to keep
just as many other such obligations are kept in this city. All
this ran through his mind upon the electric telegraph of the
brain. Flash after flash it went through, and then came the
heavy thunderbolt. He could have endured all the rest; he
could not endure that his son should marry a sewing girl.
Why? His father was a tailor, and he married a tailor's
daughter, and he hated everything that could remind him
of his own needle-and-thread origin. He hated her too, because
she was so much more lovely than his own daughters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>For five minutes he sat with the letter in his hand, glaring
at that, then at his wife and Matilda with a look of sorrow;
then at Elsie and her half-drunken husband, with contempt;
then his eye came back with a fixidity of hatred upon Walter
and Athalia.</p>

<p>At length Walter ventured to break the awful silence.</p>

<p>"Father."</p>

<p>"Don't call me father again. I disown you, you poor
milliner's apprentice. Beggar! Don't speak to me."</p>

<p>Walter paid no heed to the order, but said mildly, "is the
Matilda lost."</p>

<p>"That is my business. Leave the room."</p>

<p>His sisters took up the cue.</p>

<p>"Yes, you had better go now. Go, and set up shop.
You can carry home dresses for your wife."</p>

<p>He came to that afterwards. Then Elsie's husband put in
a word of insult.</p>

<p>"I say, Walter, it strikes me, that is rather a costly topsail
for a beggar's wife. I hope she gets her bonnets in an honest
way. Who pays the milliners' bills?"</p>

<p>Walter raised his cane to strike the villain that could
utter such a vile insinuation upon the character of a virtuous
girl, and would have paid all his tailors' bills at one blow, but
Athalia sprung upon his arm, and held it down. His father
either thought, or pretended to think, that he raised his cane
to strike him; probably not having heard the remark of
Wendall, and thinking only of his own wrongs. He seized a
bottle&mdash;a weapon that has knocked down its thousands&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
sprang forward to strike down his son. His arm was already
up, a horrid oath was struggling in his throat, his face turned
black from the effects of suffocation, he reeled, the bottle fell
to the floor with a crash, and he would have fallen down
among the broken glass and spilt wine, but for Walter, who
caught him in his arms, and bore him from the room towards
his chamber. Athalia rushed out for a physician. It was too
late!&mdash;Death had already said, "That is my business."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>While these events were transpiring in the country, others
of great import to the rich merchant's family were enacting in
the city. Creditors are not slow when they see misfortune
fall upon one, whom they were ready to bow to yesterday, to
tread upon him to-day. Creditors and their ministers,&mdash;the
judges, attorneys, sheriffs,&mdash;are all ready for a share of the
pound of the broken merchant's flesh. Shylocks still live,
and Antonios still fail.</p>

<p>That was a sad funeral cort&eacute;ge which accompanied the dead
bankrupt back to the city. Sad, not so much from sorrow,
as wounded pride and fallen greatness. It was sad to see the
daughters of a dead father absolutely refuse to travel upon
the same train, with an only brother's wife. He would not
go without her, and so they went without him. It was night
when they arrived. They had despatched John in advance,
to set the house in order, and meet them at the depot with
the carriage and a hearse. The latter was there, the former
was not, and they had to submit to the indignity of a hired
hack. At the house, all was dark. What could it mean?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
"That villain, John, has got drunk again!" That was the
fact. Who taught him? He was only following the long-studied
precepts of his employer and lady, the young ladies,
the young gentlemen, and all their fashionable associates, in
their fondness for exhilarating drink. Why should he not
get drunk?</p>

<p>They rung the bell angrily. It was a long time before it
was answered. Then a heavy footstep came down stairs&mdash;not
up from the servants' room&mdash;and approached the door, and
opened the inner one, so that he could see through the blind
who demanded admission. A sharp-faced, keen, black-eyed,
weasel-looking man, with a chamber-lamp in his hand,
and one of Mr. Morgan's dressing gowns upon his back, stood
before the astonished family with the question trembling upon
his lips, of "Vats you vant here?"</p>

<p>"Want? we want to come in, to be sure, why don't you
open the door? Who are you? What are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Vell, you can't come in. I is the sheriff's man, and he
has put me keeper here, and he tells me not to let anybody
in without his order. You must go to him. Vat you vakes
me up for?"</p>

<p>And he closed the door in their faces, and they heard his
heavy step reverberating through the long hall, and up the
broad stair-case, as he went back to his lounge, "in my lady's
chamber."</p>

<p>There were heavy hearts upon the outside of that door.
The men had brought the coffin up, and set it down upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
steps. The hearse and hired hack had driven off. There lay
the dead&mdash;he never would say, "This is my business," again&mdash;the
wine-maker might say so. Both were silent. Neither
would own his work. In the vaults of that house, three
thousand dollars worth&mdash;no, <i>cost</i>&mdash;of wines were stored.
Fifty thousand dollars worth of the richest rosewood and
mahogany furniture, china, cut glass, and silver ware, stood
idle, while its late possessor lay in his coffin upon the threshold,
with his family standing around, vainly asking permission to
rest the body of the dead owner one night, in its journey to the
tomb. What should they do? Walter, if he had been there,
could have directed what to do. He was not. Then he was
cursed in thought, if not word, because he was not there.</p>

<p>"It is all his fault," said Elsie; "it was his abominable
marriage that killed father."</p>

<p>Where was her husband? She looked around for him.
He had slipped away "to get a drink." What a brute, she
thought. So he was. That is what going to "get a drink"
makes of a man.</p>

<p>"We must go to Mr. Grundy's," said the widow.</p>

<p>How? The hearse and hack were gone, and could not
be got back in an hour. A passing cart was called, and the
coffin of the millionaire placed upon it, and the family
followed, to knock at the door of a neighbor's house, with
the same results&mdash;to be answered by another sheriff's officer,
but who, by chance, happening to be an American, and possessed
of common sense enough to know that the dead would
not steal, and those who attended upon him would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
likely to do so, he opened the door, lit the gas, called up one
or two of the servants still left in the house, and did a few
other things that natural humanity dictates upon such an
occasion. An hour after, the Grundys themselves arrived, to
find their home in the hands of a "keeper," who had let in
the Morgans by courtesy, and now admitted them as mourning
friends of the family.</p>

<p>Here, I draw the curtain. You have already seen the termination
of a man who could leave his young wife and her
dead father standing in the street, to go and "get a drink."
It was him that died in the rat hole, in Cow Bay. It was
Elsie that told how he died, how she gave birth to a child by
the side of her dead husband, and how the rats sucked up the
life blood of that child.</p>

<p>You have seen Matilda, before. Turn back to a picture, in
Chapter V., and look at her upon her wedding-day. It is
needless for me to go with you along the beaten path of her
career, down, down, down, from ball-room to bar-room; from
house of&mdash;&mdash;"a place to meet a friend"&mdash;to a house of&mdash;&mdash;"ladies'
boarding-house"&mdash;to a house of common
resort&mdash;the abode of wretchedness, woe, sin, degradation,
disease, and "painted sepulchres"&mdash;from that to a low room,
with "my man," and, finally, to fill the picture in the Twopenny
Marriage.</p>

<p>Let the curtain fall&mdash;the dead rest in peace.</p>

<p>Watch the living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="h3">ATHALIA, THE SEWING GIRL.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is their husbands' fault, if wives do fall."</p>

<p>"The weakest goes to the wall."</p></blockquote>

<p>Walter came down on the train with the Grundys. They
urged him to "abandon his folly, and go home with them."
They little thought they had no home to go to themselves.
He said, no; she was his wife, and he never would leave her.
He thought so then. If he had left the bottle, he never
would.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go, Athalia?"</p>

<p>"Come with me; I have a home."</p>

<p>So he went to her little room in Broome street. The door
was fast, and the room dark. She rapped, and was soon
answered by Jeannette's voice:</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"It is me."</p>

<p>What a world of meaning is in those three little words.
How the memory of many a wife will wander back into other
days, when she heard a midnight rap, and putting her head
out of the chamber window, where she had been "making a
frock and rocking the cradle" all the early part of the night;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and how her heart palpitates at the answer to her half spoken,
half whispered question, "Who is there?"</p>

<p>"It is me," comes up to her ready ear in the open window.
Down goes the sash, for the wind might blow on "the baby;"
they "have got a baby." In a minute, oh half that time,
"me" sees the light through the key-hole, and hears a little
step running down stairs. It stops an instant to set the lamp
on the table. What for? She could hold it in one hand,
while she unlocked the door with the other. Yes, but when
the door is open she will have work for both hands&mdash;both
arms will be around the neck of somebody.</p>

<p>"Heigho, for somebody!" I wish every loving heart had
somebody; somebody to say, "It is me."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute."</p>

<p>A little light flashed through the key-hole, then the bolt
went back with a click, then the door opened, a night-cap and
white gown, a pair of blue eyes, and some pale red curls, were
seen a moment, and then a very light scream, and Athalia
and Walter were in the dark again. The door was closed in
their faces. Was she, too, shut out from her home?</p>

<p>"Open the door, Jeannette. Never mind your night-gown."</p>

<p>"Oh. I cannot; indeed I cannot. That is not all. Charles
is here."</p>

<p>Charles there, at that time of night, and she in her night-gown!
What can it mean?</p>

<p>"Jeannette, what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't go to being angry with me, Athalia." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
she opened the door a little way, and looked out. She had
slipped on a wrapper, and slipped off the night-cap. What is
there in a night-cap, or night-gown, that a lady should be
ashamed to be seen in it?</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Jeannette?"</p>

<p>"Oh, now, don't go to being angry, Athalia, don't. Indeed
I could not help it, I was so lonesome after you went away&mdash;only
think of staying here all alone."</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Jeannette. And so because you were
lonesome, you have taken cousin Charles to sleep with you."</p>

<p>"Yes; why not?"</p>

<p>"Why not! why, Jeannette?"</p>

<p>"Why, Athalia, we are married. You don't think I would
do it if we were not, do you?"</p>

<p>"Married! ha, ha, ha! Come in Walter, you can come in
now. We are all married folks together. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>How her laugh did ring. She was anything but angry.</p>

<p>"Why, Athalia, you are only joking."</p>

<p>"No. I am in sober earnest."</p>

<p>How Jeannette did laugh, and hug, and kiss Athalia; and
then she ran to the bed, and there was a "kiss in the dark."</p>

<p>"Come, Charley, get up and see the bride. Come, we are
all married folks together."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jeannette, we must not carry on so with Walter now."</p>

<p>"Why not? Are we not all married? If we cannot carry
on a little now, I don't know when we should."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Walter's father is dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! don't say that."</p>

<p>"I must; it is true. And Walter must stay here to-night;
how shall we fix it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is very easy. There are two matrasses on the
bedstead; we will lay one down here&mdash;the bolster will do for
pillows&mdash;there are some nice clean sheets, and a spread. We
will just take that side curtain and turn it round, and pin it
to the window curtain, and then you see how easy it will be
to have two beds and two bed-rooms. You and I will sleep
on the floor, and Charles and Walter shall sleep on the bed."</p>

<p>No; that would never do. Charles and Walter would
both sleep on the floor, and their wives should sleep where
they always had, together on the bed.</p>

<p>That the girls would not listen to. They were their guests,
and they must sleep on the bedstead&mdash;that was the state bed&mdash;the
bed of honor&mdash;Walter had never slept on the floor in
his life. Then the men put in their argument, and thus the
question stood, until it seemed likely that both beds would remain
unoccupied. Finally, it was settled by "compromise."
Charley whispered Jeannette, and Jeannette answered aloud,
"Why not? So we will. Husbands and wives should
sleep together. Always together. What business has a man
sleeping with anybody else?"&mdash;with another woman she
thought.</p>

<p>So it was settled how they should sleep. Then there
was another contention where, that seemed likely to be as
interminable as the first. Finally, Athalia settled it. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
took Walter by the arm and said, "Come," leaving Jeannette
and Charley with the light, "because they were married longer
and were more used to it."</p>

<p>Walter was soon asleep. Athalia lay listening to a low
conversation between Charles and Jeannette, in which she
caught, now and then, a word. "The West&mdash;new country&mdash;log
cabin&mdash;little farm&mdash;cows, and pigs, and chickens&mdash;and a
baby"&mdash;she thought that&mdash;and she thought how happy they
will be, and how much better off than here in the city. So
she was not at all surprised when Jeannette told her, in the
morning, what they had concluded to do. In three days
they did it.</p>

<p>When I was in their little cabin, and heard from the lips of
Jeannette several things that I should not have known otherwise,
I found that they had realized all their hopes, for they
had not built them high. And when she found that I knew
Athalia, how she did hang upon my arm, and insist that I
should stay all night, and sleep in the little bed-room where
the rose-bush I had so much admired, overhung the window,
and tell her the story, how she got along, and what became
of her, and all about it.</p>

<p>Shall I begin at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the
end?</p>

<p>"Oh, at the beginning, to be sure. Where is she now?
Is she alive?"</p>

<p>That is it; you are a true woman. You tell me to begin
at the beginning, and then the very first question you ask is
about the end. I see you are impatient, and so I will gratify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
you. I will begin at the beginning of the end, and finish in
the middle. Athalia, poor girl, she is&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that&mdash;not dead!"</p>

<p>No, no; she is alive and very well, and almost as pretty
as ever. She is a widow, and lives in New York, and keeps
a boarding house, and is making a comfortable living.</p>

<p>"A widow! why, where is her husband?"</p>

<p>Why, where should he be? if she is a widow, he must be
either dead or in California; it is about all the same in New
York.</p>

<p>"What did he die of?"</p>

<p>The same disease that kills nine-tenths of his class&mdash;rum!</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, and he such a fine young man. I would have
married him myself, if it had not been for Charley. Well, I
have one great blessing; if Charles is not so rich as Walter,
he is as sober as a judge. Oh, I forgot to tell you that he is
almost one; he is Justice of the Peace. But do tell me, did
Walter leave her rich? The Morgans were very wealthy."</p>

<p>Ah, I see now; Athalia never told of their failure, and how
all their wealth vanished like morning dew; that all those
five dollar carpets, thousand dollar mirrors, and single chairs
that cost more than all your neat furniture, were sold under
the hammer to pay debts; and that Walter had not a cent in
the world, and that he lived a long time upon the money
which she earned, with,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'Work, work, work.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From weary chime to chime,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Through many a day and many a night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'As prisoners work for crime;'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>until she sighed and sung:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Oh, for only one short hour,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To feel as I used to feel,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Before I knew the woes of want,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the walk that costs a meal.'"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And did Walter do nothing?"</p>

<p>What could he do? He knew nothing&mdash;had never
learned to do anything; besides that, how could he take to
any occupation, when he had always been above work, and
free from want. If his father had put him into his counting-room
with old Precision, he might have been a good bookkeeper,
and could now have had employment upon a salary.
As it was, he was a useless, worthless member of society.
His father had been asked, if he did not think of putting
Walter into some situation where he would learn to help himself,
but his answer was, "that is my business;" and there
ended the matter.</p>

<p>Finally, after some months of idleness, supported by his
young wife's toil, a few friends concluded to advance him a
thousand dollars, to go South, where, as he thought, he could
make a fortune; and if he got away where nobody knew him,
he could go into some sort of business. Athalia went with
him. They landed at Savannah, put up at the best hotel,
four dollars a day, and wine and cigars, upon an average, six
more. It was easy to calculate just how long a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
dollars would last at that business. Athalia pined in idleness;
of course, a young "Northern merchant's" wife could
not use her needle in a city where a lady, of any pretensions
to fashion, would not help herself to a glass of water if the
pitcher stood at her elbow. A slave, always ready at her
bidding, must be called to wait upon "young missus."</p>

<p>It did not take Walter long to form new acquaintances;
besides, he met with several of his old college chums, and so
it was a day here and a night there, upon this plantation and
that; of course, his pretty wife was always welcome, so long
as nobody knew that she was a sewing girl. That secret
leaked out at last, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>Then those who had courted and fawned around the rich
merchant's wife, and thought she was the prettiest and best
bred woman, and most intelligent, they had ever met with,
and the most modest and most amiable&mdash;</p>

<p>"So she was. I never saw her equal."</p>

<p>Nor they either&mdash;but then she was a sewing girl, when he
married her&mdash;perhaps never was married. That was finally
annexed by envious, malicious, jealous rivals, who felt her
superiority, and how much more she was admired by the
gentlemen than they were.</p>

<p>All this came at last, by a true friend&mdash;a slave&mdash;to Athalia's
ear. She had felt the chilling change, and, finally, obtained
the secret from her yellow chambermaid. Her mind was
instantly made up. That night she packed her trunk; Walter,
as usual, was out "attending to business," such as young men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
often attend to at midnight in some private back room, sitting
around a table, counting spots upon little bits of pasteboard.</p>

<p>The steamboat would leave the next morning for Charleston.
She waited in vain for Walter, and then wrote a long
letter, detailing all the facts and giving ample reasons for her
course, and begging him to abandon his; to settle up what
matters he had as soon as possible and follow her. Then she
laid down for a short nap, with orders to Mary to wake her if
Mr. Morgan came in, and if not, to call her in time for the
boat at any rate, and then to give him the letter. It was an
impulsive step, but that was her nature.</p>

<p>"So it was. She always thought and acted at the same
moment; and almost always right."</p>

<p>In one week she was back in her old room, which she had
let temporarily during her absence. In one week more she
had an additional room and a few girls at work for her at
dress-making. She issued her little card, sent it around to
old customers, and got some new ones, and all the work
that she could do.</p>

<p>In three months she had ceased to pay rent for furniture;
she had bought and paid for it, and was making weekly
deposits of little sums in the savings bank. Then her husband
came back. Where his thousand dollars had gone you
may judge, when I tell you that Athalia had to go and redeem
his trunk, retained on board a brig for his passage. He could
not go himself for it, he was sick; with what complaint you
may easily judge; I shall not tell you, as he did not tell his
wife, until she too was sick, and in her ignorance, neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to call a physician, until so bad that she was laid up from
work, and of course lost custom. How her little store
melted under this accumulation of expense! Finally, they
got agoing again, and she persuaded him to get into some
kind of employment. What could he do? There was but
one "genteel"&mdash;mark the word&mdash;business that he knew of.
He became a bar keeper. He had one regular customer.
It was Walter Morgan!</p>

<p>Down hill is an easy road. He took it.</p>

<p>Athalia soon found some of her best customers dropping
off.</p>

<p>"What was the cause?"</p>

<p>There were two. In the first place Walter had been the
means of getting a notorious courtezan to give her custom to
his wife. He brought her there and introduced her as Mrs.
Layton, formerly of South Carolina, now living with her
nieces and daughter in this city. She used to come often,
always in her carriage, with liveried servants.</p>

<p>Once Athalia rode home with her to fit a dress to "a sick
young lady, that boarded with her." She found that Mrs.
Layton lived in an elegant four story house, near a church and
in a very respectable neighborhood in a fashionable street.</p>

<p>Her rooms were furnished with a degree of splendor almost
equal to the Morgans. Little did she suspect the character
of the house, particularly as her husband had introduced her
there.</p>

<p>But there was another cause why she lost her best customers.
In a fashionable soir&eacute;e, to which Walter still found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
his way occasionally, when questioned by a score of his old
acquaintances, with whom he used to flirt, and every one of
whom were envious and jealous of Athalia, they rallied him
most unmercifully upon his marriage with a sewing girl, and
then the base cowardly wretch&mdash;rum makes such of gentlemen&mdash;declared
upon his honor that he was not married.
It was only a marriage of convenience.</p>

<p>"A mistress&mdash;a mistress&mdash;oh! that alters the case. And
only to think we have been getting the shameless thing to
make our common dresses. Well, I never will go near her
again."</p>

<p>"Nor I. Nor I. Nor I."</p>

<p>"And that accounts for what I heard the other day, that
she was seen riding home with that Madame Layton, who
keeps a house of assignation in &mdash;&mdash; street."</p>

<p>"How did she know that she kept such a house!"</p>

<p>It was Matilda Morgan, that said it. She had been there.</p>

<p>The train once lighted, which fires the dry prairie, how it
sweeps on before the wind. It little regards who stand in
the way. As little regards the slanderer, and as rapidly
spreads the fire of a scandalous tongue, devouring its victims
with a consuming fire.</p>

<p>Athalia was a victim. The man who should have been
her shield, had himself thrown the first dart. It had been
more envenomed by a pretended female friend, who had
told her all that he said. She could have forgiven him everything
else, she would not forgive him that. Things now
looked dark. She was obliged to look for work among a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
class of customers where nothing but the direst necessity
would have led her. Her husband had tended bar, until his
employer found that he drank up all the profits. Now he
was drinking up the hard earnings of his wife. Then he
began to stay out nights. Where, she could only guess. One
day she sent him to pay the rent. It was the last money she
had. About a week after, the landlord called for it. He had
not seen Walter, had not been paid, and was very sorry for
her, but he must have the rent.</p>

<p>"Would he wait a few days? she hoped her husband would
pay it."</p>

<p>There was a curl of derision upon his lip. What could it
mean?</p>

<p>"Fact is, Mrs. Morgan, or Miss Lovetree, or whatever your
name is, I let the premises to you, and look to you for the
rent. I shall not run after such a miserable drunken &mdash;&mdash; as
Walter Morgan."</p>

<p>She did not drop dead under this heavy blow; she simply
said, "you shall have your rent to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Very well then; and you may as well look for a new place
too, in the course of the week."</p>

<p>"I intend to," was her calm reply.</p>

<p>When he was gone, she slipt on her bonnet and shawl, and
thought she would take her watch and ear-rings, and a few
little things, where her husband had twice taken them before,
and whence she had redeemed them, after he had spent the
money; for money he would have, and if she did not give it
to him, he would steal her things and pawn them. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
done so now. All was gone, even her large Bible, the present
of her dying mother. Her only alternative was to get a
Jew to come and look at the furniture, and advance enough to
pay the rent. On the way she thought she would take a
dress home, and got the money for that. She knew it was
going to a house of bad repute; she had been obliged to work
for such, and on several occasions Walter had carried them
home. It was a sort of perquisite with him to get the pay for
such. She looked for the dress, that too was gone. There was
another to go to the same house, which she could finish in
about an hour. It was her only resource for the necessities
of to-morrow. At nine o'clock she took it upon her arm and
went out, and with trembling step, up to the door of a magnificent
house, only one block from Broadway.</p>

<p>As the door opened for her, half-a-dozen "up town bloods,"
came out.</p>

<p>"I say," said one of them, before he was out of her hearing,
"I say, Fred, that is Walt. Morgan's gal, let us go back and
see the fun."</p>

<p>The voice was familiar, though the bloated countenance of
the rou&eacute; was not. She had heard it before. It was George
Wendall.</p>

<p>"See the fun"&mdash;what could it mean? She felt like anything
but fun. Is it fun for a man to see a woman's heart
broken?</p>

<p>They went on, Fred remarking, "she is dev'lish pretty;
curse me if I don't try my hand there. I will walk into her
affections."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the opinion of the rou&eacute;&mdash;that the door of woman's
affections is always open for every self-conceited puppy to
walk in.</p>

<p>Her heart was in her throat. She choked it down, and
went in and inquired for Miss Nannette, and was shown up
to her room. A gentleman was there, whom Nannette introduced
as Mr. Smith, from the South.</p>

<p>He might be from the South, but Athalia knew him to be
a married man, with a sweet young wife and two children, in
this city.</p>

<p>The dress was to be tried on, and Nannette began to strip
off without a blush. Athalia did blush, and did object, and
would not stay.</p>

<p>"Well, then, George, go down a few minutes to the parlor,
that is a good soul, she is so fastidious."</p>

<p>No, he did not want to be seen there; he would go home.</p>

<p>"Well, then, give me some money to pay for making this
dress. You gave me the stuff, you might as well go the
whole figure."</p>

<p>He handed her a ten dollar bill; she handed it to Athalia,&mdash;the
dress was only five&mdash;remarking:</p>

<p>"Give him the change; I won't take but a five out of it
this time."</p>

<p>Athalia had no change. She looked at him, to be certain
of her man, and remarked:</p>

<p>"No; I will keep the whole, and credit him the balance,
on account of seven dollars he has owed me these two months,
for work for his wife."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>He stammered something about mistake&mdash;not him&mdash;cursed
blunder&mdash;and left the room.</p>

<p>The dress fitted beautifully, and Athalia felt the soothing
influence of praise for her work, and would have left happier
than she came, but just then her ear caught a voice in the
next room. She listened. A woman replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, if you have brought any money. I have made up
my mind that you shall not stay in this room another night
without you give me more money."</p>

<p>"Oh, Josephine, I have got something better than money
for you. Look here."</p>

<p>"Oh! you are a dear good fellow, after all. What a pretty
watch, and what a dear little locket. That will do. Now
you may stay all night, and to-morrow we will go down to
Coney Island again, and have a good time. I'll pass for your
wife, you know."</p>

<p>There was a door opening out of Nannette's room into a
bath-room, and out of that, a window into the room where
the voices came from.</p>

<p>It was but a thought; thoughts are quick, and so were her's,
and the step that took her up on a chair, and her hand up
to the curtain, which was the only thing preventing her from
seeing who owned that voice.</p>

<p>She looked. What a sight for a wife! She saw, what she
knew before, but would be doubly sure, that the voice was her
husband's. She knew that&mdash;she knew that he was giving
her watch, and the locket which contained the donor's likeness,
that of a dear brother lost at sea&mdash;a treasure that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
would not part with sooner than her own heart&mdash;to a woman
to whom he had before given money&mdash;money that came, drop
by drop, distilled from her heart's blood, through the alembic
of her needle; and she would see&mdash;what woman would not&mdash;what
wife could resist the opportunity of seeing?&mdash;she could
not&mdash;what the woman looked like, who could displace her
in her husband's affections. The first sight she caught was
her Bible upon the table.</p>

<p>"What could she want of that?"</p>

<p>She was sometimes religious&mdash;a great many of them are,
and read the Bible to find some text to justify their own
course. They are also visited by clergymen, who prefer
those of "a religious turn of mind." Then this Bible was
elegantly bound, and very valuable. Then she saw her watch
in the hands of a woman with ugly red hair, with dull,
voluptuous eyes, thick lips, ugly teeth, a little snub nose, and
a gaunt awkward figure, forming altogether one of the ugliest
looking women, Athalia thought, that she had ever seen.
The words burst involuntarily from her lips:</p>

<p>"Oh, how ugly!"</p>

<p>"She is uglier than she looks," said Nannette. "She has
ruined more men than any other woman in the city. She
has kicked that fool out half a dozen times because he did
not give her more money. I should not wonder now, if he
has stolen his wife's watch to give that wretch."</p>

<p>And this was the woman that Athalia had been toiling
for her husband to pamper. Oh, how she did pray to
die!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Nannette, when she learned the facts, was furious. She
would have gone in and torn her heart out.</p>

<p>She said she never did have anything to do with a married
man, if she knew it. George had lied to her, and never
should see her but once again&mdash;once, to get her blessing.</p>

<p>Athalia was calm. She sat down a few minutes, to recover
from this last stab in the heart, and then said she would look
once more and then go home. She did look, and saw her
husband locked in the arms of that red-headed fury. Then
she went home; she did not go to bed; she worked all night
putting her things in order. Next day, at ten o'clock, a red
flag was fluttering at her window, and while Walter and his
mistress were going down the Bay, her furniture was "going,
going, gone," to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>At sundown she was homeless, friendless, worse than husbandless,
alone, in the streets of New York!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Although all my scenes are connected, and bear some
relation one to the other, yet they are not continuous. Like
the Panorama of Niagara, we must go back, cross over, look
up, look down, first from this point of view, then from that,
to see all the scenes of that wonder of wonders. So here,
where a mighty torrent rushes on, sweeping a multitude down
the great cascade, we have to look at scene after scene, before
we can join them all together into one panoramic view. Our
scenes, too, are as real and life-like as those. Sometimes a
tree here, a flower there, then a little spray, then a cloud, or
the natural color, a little heightened to give effect, and make
the picture more vivid; but the rocks and rushing torrent, the
real foundation of the picture, are all as nature made them.
So it is with my present panoramic view of "Life Scenes
in New York."</p>

<p>Again I shift the scene. Still you will find characters that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

<p>I suppose there are some who will turn away in disgust
from the double title of this chapter. What, they will say,
can "Life at the Five Points" have in it that is interesting to
me, who lounge on silk brocatelle, and look down upon beggar
girls and rag-pickers&mdash;disgusting objects&mdash;through lace
curtains that cost more, to every window, than would furnish
a hundred families in that locality with better furniture than
they now possess?</p>

<p>No doubt you will turn away in disgust at the very sight
of the title of "The Rag-picker's Daughter." Yet you may
find something in the character of "Madalina," which will
make you love the name. I should not wonder, in some of
my walks through the city in future years, to hear that pretty
name spoken to some sweet child, yet to be born in rose-perfumed
chamber.</p>

<p>Then pass not by my tale of one so lowly. See how sweet
is a cup of cold water to the dying.</p>

<p>Read.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the door-keeper, to Mr. Pease, one night, "little
Madalina, the beggar girl, is at the door, crying bitterly, and
says she wants to see you."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the tired missionary, "I answered hastily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
perhaps petulantly, for I had been very much engaged all
day. Tell her to go away, I cannot see her to-night; it is
eleven o'clock, and I am very tired. She must come to-morrow."</p>

<p>The poor fellow turned upon his heel to go away, but as
he did so, the glimpse of his hand and motion of the coat
sleeve across his eyes, told a story.</p>

<p>"Tom," said Mr. P., "Tom, my dear boy, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>Tom did not turn round as he had been taught, and usually
did, so as to look him full in the face when he answered; in
fact he did not answer readily; there was a choking sensation
in his utterance which prevented the words from coming forth
distinctly.</p>

<p>Now, this boy had been but a short time in "the Home,"
and perhaps a more squalid, wretched, drunken boy, cannot
be found in the purlieus of the Five Points, than he was when
he was almost literally picked out of the gutter, as he had
been once before he came here finally, in the way you have
already seen. Once before, he had actually been dragged out
of the filthiest hole in Anthony street, brought in, washed and
dressed, before he came to, so as to be conscious of the change
that had come over him. Then he was brought back again to
his low degradation, by just such wretches and ways of the
wicked as were brought to bear upon poor Reagan, and will
be upon many others, while the destroyer is permitted to walk
abroad like a pestilence at noon-day. Now this outcast, who
had cared for nothing human, not even himself, stood vainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
trying to choke down his grief for the sorrows of a little beggar
girl.</p>

<p>Were the reminiscences of one, almost as low down in the
scale of humanity, running through his mind&mdash;one who, after
having been herself lifted up, had exerted an influence upon
him to his salvation?</p>

<p>The tired missionary forgot his fatigue.</p>

<p>"Tom," said he, springing up, "I will go and see what is
the matter. Who is this Madalina?"</p>

<p>"She is an Italian rag-picker's daughter, sir&mdash;they live in
Cow Bay&mdash;I used to lodge with them sometimes. That is,
the mother picks rags, and the father goes with the hand-organ
and monkey."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is where the little tambourine girl came from that
we have now in school. There is a quarrel, I suppose, and
the little girl has come for me."</p>

<p>Tom went down stairs, with a heart as light as his step,
"which," said Mr. P., "I followed, I must acknowledge, rather
heavily, for I did not quite relish the idea of being wakened
out of a comfortable evening nap, to do police duty in Cow
Bay, and I fear there might not have been quite as much
suavity in my tone and manner towards the rag-picker's
daughter, as we ought to use when speaking to those poor
children, for I recollect the words were, 'What do you want?'
instead of, 'What can I do for you, my child&mdash;come tell me,
and don't cry any more.'"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be a beggar girl. I want to be like my
cousin Juliana."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Juliana&mdash;Juliana. I don't know her."</p>

<p>"It is the little tambourine girl, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see now. Juliana is your cousin, then. Come here
Madalina; let me look at you, and I will talk about it. Did
Juliana tell you to come here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; she has told me a good many times, but they
would not let me. I am afraid to stay there to-night, they
are drinking and fighting so bad."</p>

<p>"I thought so; and you want me to go and stop them; is
that it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I want to stay here."</p>

<p>"Oh, a poor little girl flying for fear from her own parents,
because they are drinking and fighting so."</p>

<p>He drew her forward into the light, and looked upon as fine
a set of features as he ever saw. Her hair, which, as a
matter of course, was black almost as the raven's wing, and
subsequently, when cleaned of dirt and its accompaniments,
became almost as glossy, overshadowed a pair of the keenest,
yet mildest, black eyes I ever met with. Her skin was dark,
partly natural, and partly the effect of the sun upon its
unwashed, unsheltered surface. Her teeth, oh! what a set of
teeth! which, she afterward told me, she kept clean by a
habit she had of eating charcoal. She was about twelve
years old, slim form, rather tall, but delicate structure. Her
dress consisted of a dirty cotton frock, reaching a little
below the knees, and nothing else. Barefooted, bareheaded,
almost naked, at the hour of midnight, of a cold March night,
a little innocent child, wandering through the streets of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
York, vainly plying the words, "Please give me a penny, sir,"
to well-fed, comfortably-dressed men, whose feelings have
grown callous by constantly hearing such words from such
objects, to whom to give is not to relieve, but rather encourage
to continue in the pursuit of such ill-gotten means of
prolonging life, without any prospect of benefit to themselves
or their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>"Then you don't want to beg, Madalina! Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because people push me, and curse me, and to-day one
man kicked me right here, sir." And she laid her hand upon
her stomach, and a little groan of anguish and accusation
against the unfeeling monster who had done the deed, went
to the recording angel, and was set down in the black catalogue
of rum-selling crimes, for a day of retribution yet to
come.</p>

<p>"Kicked you! What for? Were you saucy?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I am never saucy. My mother says if I am
saucy, men won't give me anything. I must be very quiet,
and not talk any, nor answer any questions."</p>

<p>"Then how came he to kick you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; I did not say a word, I only went into
one of those nice rooms in Broadway, where they have such
beautiful glass bottles and tumblers, and looking-glasses, and
such a sight of all sorts of liquor, and where so many fine
gentlemen go and sit, and talk, and laugh, and drink, and
smoke; and I just went along and held out my hand to the
gentlemen, when one of them told me to open my mouth, and
shut my eyes, and hold out my hand, and he would give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a shilling. Now look what he did&mdash;he put his cigar all
burning in my hand, and shut it up and held it there."</p>

<p>Horrible! she opened her hand, and showed three fingers
and a palm all in a blister.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, that is nothing to what another one did. He
put a great nasty chaw of tobacco in my mouth, and then I
could not help crying; then the man who sells the liquor, he
ran out from behind the counter, and how he did swear, and
caught me by the hair, and pulled me down on the floor, and
kicked me so I could hardly get away. But he told me if I
did not he would set the dogs on me and tear me to pieces."</p>

<p>"What did you go into such a place for?"</p>

<p>"I had been all day in the streets and only got three pennies,
and I wanted to go home."</p>

<p>"Well, why did you not go?"</p>

<p>"My mother said if I did not get sixpence to-day she
would whip me, and so I went to that place. I did not think
such nice dressed gentlemen would do so. What if they
should have to beg some day! My father used to dress as fine
as they when he kept the <i>Caf&eacute; de l'Imperator</i>."</p>

<p>"And where have you been since they abused you so?"</p>

<p>"I crept up into a cart in Pearl street; I was so sick,
after the tobacco and the kick, for it was very hard."</p>

<p>"Could you not get home?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Besides, what if I could, and my mother had
been drinking. She would kick me again, perhaps."</p>

<p>"What, then, are you going to do to-night? You cannot
sleep in the street; it is too cold."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't you let me sleep?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"With your cousin Juliana?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not that; she is clean, and I&mdash;I wish I was.
Won't you let me sleep on the floor?"</p>

<p>"You shall have a place to sleep to-night; and to-morrow,
if your mother is willing, you shall come and live with your
cousin Juliana, and be dressed as she is, and learn to sew;
and when you get big enough"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Her mother will prostitute her, as she did her older sister
to a miserable old pimp for ten dollars."</p>

<p>"Tom, Tom, what is that?"</p>

<p>"The truth, sir. Have I ever told you a lie since I have
been in your house?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, Tom, take Madalina to the housekeeper, and
give her somewhere to sleep to-night, and to-morrow morning
you shall go to her mother and see what she will do."</p>

<p>"Lord, sir, I must go to-night. She will be off with her
hook and basket, poking in the gutters after rags before the
stars go to bed. These rag-pickers are early birds. I have
known them travel four or five miles of a morning, to get to
their own walk."</p>

<p>"Own walk. What is that?"</p>

<p>"All the city is divided up among them. Each must keep
to his own walk. If one should trespass upon another, he
would get a wet cloth over his mouth some night when he
was asleep, and nobody would know or care how he died."</p>

<p>"The coroner's jury would inquire into the matter."</p>

<p>"Coroner! fiddlesticks! I beg your pardon, sir, but I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
not mean to answer you that way, though I did know that
coroner's juries care the least of anybody how such fellows
die. The verdict would be 'accidental death,' 'found dead,'
'died of visitation of Providence;' or, if the murderers got a
chance, which they might do easy enough, to chuck the body
in the dock, the verdict would be 'found drowned,' no matter
if he had a hole in his head as big as my fist."</p>

<p>"They could not carry the body from this neighborhood to
the river without being detected."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they. How did Ring-nosed Bill and Snakey Jo
carry Pedlar Jake from Cale Jones's to Peck-slip and send
him afloat?"</p>

<p>"What, dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, they put too much opium in his rum to get him
to sleep, so they could rob him, and he did not wake up, and
so they walked him off."</p>

<p>"Walked him off, how?"</p>

<p>"They stood him up and fastened one of their legs to his
each side, so that when they stepped his feet travelled too, and
so they-went along, talking to him and cursing him for being
so drunk, till they got to the dock."</p>

<p>"Where were the Police, do they never notice such things?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no sir, they steps round the corner when they sees
a drunken man coming, particularly if he has one of his
friends with him."</p>

<p>"And do you think, Tom, that the rag-pickers would murder
a fellow-creature who trespassed, as they call it, upon their
grounds, without compunction of conscience?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Conscience, sir, what do they know about conscience?
The 'Padre' keeps their conscience."</p>

<p>"But the law, is there no law in this Christian City?"</p>

<p>"Law, pshaw! what has your book-law to do with rag-pickers'
law?"</p>

<p>"True enough; or 'father confessors,' either."</p>

<p>The next morning Tom made his report. At first it was a
positive refusal. "She can make sixpence a day, and pick
up enough to eat."</p>

<p>"Well then she shall pay you sixpence a day. She can
soon learn to sew and earn more than that. Juliana does it
every day."</p>

<p>"But she shall not stay there nights. They will make a
Protestant of her."</p>

<p>"That was not the sticking point," says Tom, "if she stays
here, she cannot make a &mdash;&mdash; of her there. The best I could
do was to let her go home nights and come days. That is
better than nothing. The poor little thing won't have to go
begging, and be burned, and kicked, and vomited with filthy
tobacco cuds, and then whipped if she don't bring home sixpence
every night for her mother to buy rum with. If she
cannot earn it here at first, I will, and we will get her away
entirely, after a while."</p>

<p>Noble Tom! Glorious good boy! What a heart! How
long is it since thou wert as one of them, kicked and cuffed,
and groveling drunk in the gutter? Who thought then that
thy rags and filth covered such a heart? Who knew of the
virtuous lessons given thee by a pious mother; and how, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
years of forgetfulness, sin, wretchedness, misery, that that good
seed would vegetate and bring forth such sweet flowers and
good fruit, as we are now tasting in these good deeds and
kind words. What if nine of the fallen whom we lift up,
fall back again? so that one stand, who shall refuse to lend a
helping hand? Let us lift up the lowly and make the
haughty humble. Why should they do evil?</p>

<p>Again the messenger went up to the Great Recorder, and
a double deed of mercy was written down.</p>

<p>Wild Maggie, thy sins are forgiven. Look at thy work.
This is the poor outcast boy of whom you said,
"Tom, I am going to provide you with a home. You
must go to the House of Industry, reform, and make a man
of yourself."</p>

<p>The work is more than half done.</p>

<p>Madalina, though still suffering from her brutal treatment,
was a happy girl when she found that she was not to be driven
out to beg in the streets.</p>

<p>But she could not understand why her mother wanted her
to sleep at home. Tom could. "Too young! Pooh! before
she is a year-older, she will be lost." Too true! Before she
had been in "the Home" six months, she had learned to read,
write, and work, and had grown much in stature and fine
looks. Then she would have been placed in some good
family, but her mother would not consent. She still complained
of her breast, and had frequent turns of vomiting.
She always felt worse in the morning, "because," she said,
"that was such a dreadful place to sleep."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes she did not come for a few days; her mother
made her stay at home and sew. She had learned to
work, and her services were worth more at that than begging.</p>

<p>One night she came in, in great haste, crying.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Madalina?"</p>

<p>"My mother has had an offer for me."</p>

<p>"An offer for you. What is that?"</p>

<p>Tom looked daggers. "I told you so."</p>

<p>"What is it, my good girl. Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"My mother bid me go out with her this evening, both of
us dressed in our best. She said she had an offer for me, and
was going to meet the man in Duane street.</p>

<p>"'What does the man want of me, mother?' said I.</p>

<p>"'Oh, he will make a fine lady of you, and you will live
with him.'</p>

<p>"'But I don't want to live with him; I had rather live
with Mr. Pease, at "the Home." I had rather live where
Tom is, for Tom is good to me.'"</p>

<p>Young love's first happy dream!</p>

<p>"But we went on, and I held my head down, and felt very
bad. By-and-by I heard my mother say,'Here she is,' and I
looked up a little, and saw two gentlemen&mdash;that is, they were
clothed like gentlemen&mdash;and directly one spoke to the other.</p>

<p>"'I say, Jim, she will do; give the old woman the money,
and let us take her up to Kate's.'</p>

<p>"Mercy on me, that voice! I felt that sore spot in my
breast grow more and more painful. I looked up; <i>it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
man who kicked me</i>; the other was the man who put the
tobacco in my mouth."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I stood a little behind my mother while she held out her
hand for the money, and when their eyes were turned I ran.
I only heard them say, 'Why, damn her, she is gone.' Yes,
I was gone, and here I am. Oh, I am so sick and so faint!
do let me lay down, and don't let those men have me. Oh
dear, the thought of it will kill me!"</p>

<p>So it did. A cruel blow had fallen upon a tender plant.
The beggar girl might not have felt it. The little seamstress
did. A taste of virtue, civilization, christianity, friendship,
love, had given the food of sin and shame a hated taste. Sold
by a mother to a libidinous brute&mdash;to a miserable rum-selling,&mdash;worse
than rum-drinking&mdash;wretch, who wears gentlemanly
garments, and kicks, burns, and gags little beggar girls. It
was too much for human nature to bear, and it sunk under
this last blow, worse than the first.</p>

<p>Madalina went to bed with a raging fever&mdash;a nervous prostration.
All that kindness and skill could do, was done for
the poor sufferer; but what could we do for the body, when
the heart was sick?</p>

<p>Next morning her mother came and insisted that she should
go home. They begged, pleaded, and promised in vain; go
she must.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Madalina, "it will be only for a little,
little while. I shall be well&mdash;at least all will be well with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in a few days. I cannot endure this pain in my breast.
You will come and see me. Good bye. Tom, you will?"</p>

<p>It was an honest, manly tear that Tom turned away to hide.
Poor fellow, he need not have been ashamed of it. Such is
nature.</p>

<p>"She is worse, sir," said Tom, one morning, "and no wonder.
I wish you would go and see her; she wants to see you
once more. Such a place to be sick in! oh, dear! how did I
ever sleep there? I wish you would go with me to-night,
about ten o'clock, when they are all in. You will see life as
it is."</p>

<p>"Very well, Tom, I will go. Call for me at ten, or when
you are ready."</p>

<p>It was my fortune to drop in upon that very evening, and
form one of the company to that abode of misery,&mdash;that home
of the city poor,&mdash;so that I am able to describe it in my own
language. The place where Madalina lived, is a well known
Five Points locality, called "Cow Bay."</p>

<p>As you go up that great Broadway of wealth, fashion, luxury,
and extravagance of this great city, from the Park and its
marble halls of justice, you will pass another great marble front&mdash;it
is the palace of trade, where the rich are clothed every
day in fine linens, when they go "shopping at Stewart's."
Further along are great marts, where velvet coverings for the
floor are sold; for there are some who have never trod upon
bare boards. You need not look down Duane street, unless
you have a curiosity to see the spot where a miserable mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
would sell the virtue of her child to a wretch whose trade is
seduction. Don't look into that little old wooden shanty at
the comer of Pearl street; it is a "family grocery." The little
ragged girl you see coming out with a rusty tin coffee-pot,
has not been there for milk for her sick mother&mdash;her father
is in the hospital on the opposite side of the way&mdash;his arm
was broken in a "family quarrel." You will pass the Broadway
Theatre before you reach the next corner, with its surroundings
of fashionable "saloons," into any of which you
may go without fear of losing caste among genteel brandy-smashers
and wine-bibbers. Perhaps you will be amused
with a small play, such as burning, kicking, or vomiting a
little beggar girl; for nice young men are fond of theatrical
amusements. Do not go into that place of "fashionable
resort," the theatre, if it is a hot evening, for it is worse ventilated
than the black-hole of Calcutta, and if the fetid air
does not breed a fever, it will breed a feverish thirst, which
will tempt you to quench it in potations of poison. Probably
that is why it was thus built.</p>

<p>A few steps beyond is Anthony street. Stop a moment
here, and look up and down the great thoroughfare of New-York
before you leave it. A hundred pedestrians pass you
every minute; almost without an exception, every one of them
richly dressed men and women, smiling in joy and happiness.
Here is an exception, certainly. A woman in poverty's
garb, with a bundle of broken boards and old timbers, from
a demolished building, that would be a load for a pack-horse.
She is followed by two little boys, with each a bundle, crushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
their young years into early decrepitude. They have
brought their heavy loads all the long way from Murray street.
They turn down Anthony; look where they go. If they live
in that street, it cannot be far, for there, in plain view, stands
a large frame house, corner-wise towards you, right in the
middle of the street. No, it only looks so, it is beyond the
end of it. Yet look, note it well, the corner of that house so
plain in view, pointing towards you, is one of the world-wide-known
Five Points of New-York.</p>

<p>"What! not so near Broadway, right in plain sight of all
who wear silks and broadcloth, and go up and down that
street every day? Surely that is not the place where all those
bad, miserable, poor outcasts live, that the newspapers talk so
much about."</p>

<p>"The very spot, my dear lady."</p>

<p>"Really, this must be looked to. It is quite too bad to
think that place is so near our fashionable street, and in sight
too. I thought it was away off somewhere the <i>other</i> side of
town. If I thought it would do any good, I would let Peter
take a few dollars and some old clothes, and go down with
them to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Try it, madam. Better go yourself. Let Peter drive you
down; see for yourself what has been done and what is yet
to do. Lend your hand to cure that eye-sore, which will pain
you every time you pass, for you cannot shut it out of sight,
now you know where it is; so near your daily walk or drive
to Stewart's, or nightly visit to the theatre, or weekly visit to
the church. Go to-morrow; don't put it off till next week."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, reader, let us follow the woman and two
boys with their heavy burden, on their homeward way to-night.
We will go and see where they live.</p>

<p>So I followed down Anthony, past some very old rat-harbor
houses, filled with human beings, almost as thick as
those quadrupeds burrow in a rotten wharf; so on they go
across Elm; now they stand a moment on the edge of Centre,
for one of the little boys has taken hold of his mother's dress
to pull her back&mdash;for she cannot look up with her load&mdash;with
a sudden cry of, "Stop, old woman! Don't you see the car is
coming? Why, you are as blind as a brick. That is black
Jim a-driving, and he had just as soon drive over the likes of
you as eat. Hang you for a fool, han't you got no sense, old
stupid? There now, run like thunder, blast ye, for here
comes another of the darned cars&mdash;run, I tell you!"</p>

<p>She did run with her great load, till she almost dropped under
its overwhelming weight. Why should she thus labor&mdash;thus
expend so much strength to so little purpose? She knew no
other way to live. Nobody gave her remunerative labor for
strong hands; nobody took those two stout boys, and set
them to till the earth, or taught them how to create bread,
and yet they must eat, and so they prowl about the pulled-down
houses, snatching everything they can carry away&mdash;a
sort of permitted petty larceny, that teaches those who practice
it how to do bigger deeds; and those old timbers they split
up into kindling wood and peddle through the streets.</p>

<p>Poor uncared for fellow creatures; working and stealing to
escape starvation&mdash;living, for what?&mdash;running to escape being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
run over by an unfeeling driver who cared just as much for
them as for so many dogs.</p>

<p>On they went, down Anthony street; and I followed, determined
to see the <i>home</i> of this portion of the city poor. It was
but one block further&mdash;only one little space beyond this great,
wide, open, railroad street, whose thoughtless thousands daily
go up and down from homes of wealth to wealth-producing
ships and stores, little thinking of the amount of human
misery within a stone's throw of the rails on which they
glide swiftly along.</p>

<p>One block further, and the street opens into a little, half
acre sort of triangular space, sometimes dignified with the
name of "park," but why, those who know can only tell, for
it has no fence, no grass, and but a dozen miserable trees; 'tis
lumbered up with carts and piles of stones, and strings of
drying clothes, and scores of unwashed specimens of young
humanity, whose home is in the dirt, whether in the street or
parents' domicil.</p>

<p>Here let us stop and look around. A very short street,
only one block across the base of the "park," runs to the right
from where we stand, past the "Five Points House of Industry,"
to Cross street. This is the most notorious little street
in New York. Its name is Little Water street. It lead from
the "Old Brewery" to "Cow Bay." Who that has lived long
in this city, or read its history, particularly that portion of it
written by Dickens, has not heard of the "Old Brewery?"
It is not there now. That awful den of crime, poverty, and
wretched drunken misery has been pulled down, and in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
place a substantial brick edifice, in which is a chapel and
school-room, and home of another missionary, has been erected
by the noble, generous efforts of the Ladies' Home Missionary
Society, of the Methodist Church. The old tenants have been
driven out or reformed. How different, too, are the present
occupants of that large brick pile in Little Water street, from
those who filled its numerous rooms before the missionary
came there. Every room was a brothel or a den of thieves,
or both combined. Now it is a house of prayer&mdash;a home for
the homeless&mdash;a place of refuge for midnight wandering little
beggar girls.</p>

<p>Before us lies the misnamed, neglected triangle, called a
park. At the further end is the frame house that we see so
plainly as we look down Anthony street from Broadway. At
the left, as though it were a continuation of Little Water
street, lies that notorious Five Points collection of dens of
misery, Cow Bay. It is a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, perhaps thirty feet wide
at the mouth, narrowing, with crooked, uneven lines, back to
a point about a hundred feet from the entrance. Into this
court I tracked the kindling-wood-splitters, and threaded my
way among the throng of carts and piles of steaming garbage;
elbowing my way along the narrow side-walk, and up a flight
of broken, almost impassable steps, I reached the first floor
hall of one of the houses, just in time to see that great load
of wood and its bearer toiling up a narrow, dark, broken stairway,
which I essayed to climb; but just then, from the room
on the left, at the foot of the stairs, there came such a piercing,
murder-telling, woman's shriek, that I started back, grasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
my stout cane, determined to brave the worst for the rescue,
made one step, pushed open the door, creaking with a horrid
grating upon its rusty hinges, and stood in the presence of an
Eve, before the fall, in point of clothing, but long, long after
that in point of sin. As I entered the open door, she sprung
towards it; her husband caught her by the hair, and drew
her back, with no gentle hand or word.</p>

<p>"Let me go, let me go&mdash;help!&mdash;he wants to murder me;
let me go&mdash;help, help, help!"</p>

<p>I did help, but it was help to the poor man, for she turned
upon him with the fury of a tiger, scratching and tearing his
face and clothes, and then settling with a grasp upon his throat,
which produced the death-rattle of suffocation.</p>

<p>A strong silk handkerchief served the hand-cuff's place, and
to bind hands and feet together; after which she lay quietly
upon a little straw and rags, in one corner, the only articles
of furniture in the room, except a bottle, broken cup, and
something that looked as though it once had been female
apparel.</p>

<p>"Is this your wife?"</p>

<p>"She was."</p>

<p>"What is she now?"</p>

<p>"The devil's fury. You saw what she is."</p>

<p>"Do you live with her?"</p>

<p>"I did for seven years."</p>

<p>"Did she drink then?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;not so bad."</p>

<p>"Did you drink?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, none to hurt. I kept a coffee house."</p>

<p>"And made your wife a drunkard. How came she
reduced to this dreadful condition? You are well dressed."</p>

<p>"I left her three months ago, and went West to find a
place to move to. She said if she could go where nobody
knew her she would reform. I left her in a comfortable
room, with good furniture and good clothes. Now, where
are they? All gone to the pawnbroker's; the money gone
for rum&mdash;her virtue, shame, everything gone. How, what,
and where do I find her? As you see, crazy drunk, in this
miserable hole, in Cow Bay. And my boy, starved, made
drunk, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, have you a child by her, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a sweet little boy, six years old. Oh, I wish he was
awake, that you might see him."</p>

<p>And he stepped to the miserable bed, and lifted the dirty
rag of a quilt, looked a moment upon the pale boy, dropped
upon his knees, raised him in his arms, looked again wildly, and
fell back fainting as he exclaimed, "Great God, he is dead!"</p>

<p>What little I could do or say to relieve such heart-crushing
woe as overwhelmed this poor father of that murdered
child&mdash;this miserable husband of that wretched, crazy&mdash;rum-crazy
woman, was soon done. What else could I do
than call in a police officer to take her away to prison?
whence she went to the hospital, then to the drunkard's
uncared-for, unwept-over grave!</p>

<p>Now, strange footsteps are winding up the rickety stairs,
which I follow. They were those of Tom and the Missionary,
for here lived little Madalina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The second floor was divided into three rooms. We looked
in as we passed. The back room was ten by twelve feet
square, inhabited by two black men and their wives, and a
white woman lodger, who "sometimes has company." Here
they eat, drink, and sleep,&mdash;cook, wash, and iron. The
latter operation is performed on the bottom of the wash-tub,
for there is no table. The front room, eight by fourteen feet,
contained five blacks, men and women. Each of these rooms
rented for four dollars a month, <i>in advance</i>.</p>

<p>A dark centre room, occupied by a white woman, was only
six by seven feet, for which she paid fifty cents a week. On
the third floor, the dark centre room, same size, was occupied
by a real good looking, young, healthy German woman, with
her husband, a great burly negro, as black as Africa's own
son, and a fine looking little white boy, four years old, as a
lodger. We found the door shut, and no ventilator bigger
than the key-hole. There <i>was</i> a smell about the air.</p>

<p>In the back room, ten by twelve, we found the wood-splitters&mdash;the
woman and her two boys, a negro and his wife, a
woman lodger, and occasional company. The rent of this
room is one dollar a week in advance. The total amount of
furniture, was not good security for one week's rent.</p>

<p>"Good woman, why do you bring all your great piles of
wood up these steep, slippery stairs, to fill up your room?"</p>

<p>"Cot in himmel, vare vould I puts him? In te court?
De peoples steal him all."</p>

<p>True, there was no place but in that one room to store up
a supply, while the time of gleaning was good. Then it has
to be carried down to the court, to be split up into kindlings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and then again carried up for storage. How so many find
room to live in such narrow space, if our readers would learn,
let them go and make personal inquiry. They will find
plenty of just such cases, with slight search.</p>

<p>Up, up again, one more flight of creaking stairs, without
bannisters, the thin worn steps bending beneath our tread,
and we are on the upper floor of this one of a hundred just
alike "tenant houses." Along the dark, narrow passage,
opening by that low door at the end, into a room under the
roof, ten by fifteen feet, lighted by one dormer window, and
we are in the home of Madalina, the rag-picker's daughter.
Home! Can it be that that holy name has been so desecrated&mdash;that
this child, with sylph-like form and angel face,
must call this room her home. 'Tis only for a little while!
She will soon have another!</p>

<p>In one corner of the room stood two hand organs, such as
the most of us city dwellers are daily tormented with, groaning
out their horrid music under our windows, while the
grinder and his monkey look anxiously for falling pennies or
pea-nuts. These stand a little way apart, with a couple of
boards laid across the space. On these boards there had
been an attempt to make a bed, of sundry old coats, a dirty
blanket, and other vermin harbors.</p>

<p>On this bed lay the poor little sufferer. Not so very little
either. In her own native Italy she had been counted almost
a woman.</p>

<p>We have seen many, many beautiful faces, but never one
like this&mdash;so angelic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a bad sign," said Tom, in answer to a remark upon
the expression of her face; "it is a sign she will soon be
among those she looks so much like. She never looked so
before. She is a living angel now, she will soon be a real
one."</p>

<p>"Madalina, my good child," said the missionary, "how do
you feel to-night?"</p>

<p>"The pain in my breast has been very bad, but it is easier
now. It always goes away when you come. I am so glad
you came to-night, for I wanted to thank you for a thousand
good things you have done for me."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid you will not get well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I am not afraid; I know I shall not, but I am
not afraid. I don't want to live, if I must live here; look
around. It did not use to look as it does now to me; when
I went out begging, and came home tired and cold and hungry,
I could lay down with the monkeys on my mother's bag
of nasty, wet rags, and go to sleep directly. Now they worry
me to death with their chattering. Do drive them down,
Tom, that is a dear, good fellow."</p>

<p>It would evidently have been a source of great gratification
to Tom, to have pitched five or six of them out of the window.
But there were dark eyes scowling on him, out of a
dozen sockets of men who come from the land of the stiletto,
and looked now as though they could as readily use it as
play the organ and lead the monkey.</p>

<p>I looked about, and counted six men or stout boys, and
eight women and girls, besides several children, monkeys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
tambourines and hand organs. In one corner was the rag-picker's
store. This had been the bed of Madalina until this
evening, she grew so much worse, that she was lifted up to the
bed I have described. But here she had not escaped the
torment of the monkeys. They had long been her companions
and seemed determined to be so still. They were climbing up
and down, or sitting chattering on her bed. Late as it was in
the evening there were several fresh arrivals of parties of
musicians and rag-pickers from their distant walks. Several
were at supper. A long, black table with a wooden bench,
on either side, was furnished with two wooden trays, which
had seen long service and little soap. Into these was ladled
from time to time, the savory contents of a large pot simmering
upon the stove. Each guest helped himself with fingers
and spoon. Whether the stew was composed of monkey
meat, or two days old veal, I cannot say. That onions
formed a strong part of the ingredients, we had olfactory
demonstration. Some of the party indulged in a bottle of
wine, and we smelt something very much like bad rum or
worse brandy; but generally speaking, this class of the city
poor are not great drunkards. One end of the room was
entirely occupied by a camp bed. That is, in that narrow
space of ten feet, ten human beings, big and little, of both
sexes, laid down side by side. The balance of the family lay
around here and there; some on and some under the table,
some on great black chests, of which each family had one,
wherein they lock all their personal goods from their pilfering
room mates. The stove and a few dishes finishes the catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of furniture. How many persons are, or can be stowed
into this one room, is beyond my powers of computation.</p>

<p>Will some of my readers, who faint at the smell of unsavory
food, or who could not sleep but in fresh linen and well aired
rooms, fancy what must be the feelings of poor Madalina,
who had just begun to taste of the comforts of civilized life,
now sick and dying in such a room, where the penny candle
only served to make the thick clouds of tobacco smoke more
visible and more suffocating?</p>

<p>One of the difficulties in all these close-packed rooms is the
necessity of keeping the door always shut, to prevent pilfering,
thus leaving the only chance for fresh air to enter, or
foul air to escape, by the one small window in the roof.</p>

<p>Having given you a view of the room, and its inhabitants
and furniture, let us look again upon poor Madalina, as she
lies panting for breath upon her hard pallet. Her face,
naturally dark, has an unhealthy whiteness spread over it, and
there is a small, bright crimson spot upon one cheek&mdash;the
other is hidden in the taper fingers of the hand upon which it
rests. Such a pair of bright black eyes! Oh, how beautiful!
Her wavy locks of jet, are set off by a clean, white handkerchief,
spread over the bundle of rags which forms her pillow,
by one of her visitors. Now, in spite of pain, there is a smile
lighting up her face, and showing such a set of teeth as a
princess might covet. Whence this happy smile? Listen
how cheaply it is brought upon the face of the suffering
innocent. She had said, "I am so thirsty, and nothing to
drink but nasty, warm tea." Directly, Tom was missing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>Now he was back again, and there he stood with a nice, white
pitcher in one hand, full of ice water, and a glass tumbler in
the other. Now he pours it full of the sparkling nectar&mdash;now
he drops upon one knee and carries it to those parched lips.
Is it any wonder that she smiles? Is it any wonder that that
simple-minded, good-hearted boy should look up, as I stood
looking over the kneeling Missionary, and say, "Don't she
look like an angel, sir?"</p>

<img src="images/page_226.jpg" width="476" height="570" alt="THE DEATH-BED OF MADALINA." title="">
<span class="caption">THE DEATH-BED OF MADALINA.</span>
</div>

<p>It was an angelic smile. It was a sight worth days and
nights of earnest seeking, and yet, Oh, how cheaply purchased.
Only one glass of cold water!</p>

<p>Would that I had some Raphaelic power to transfer the
picture of that scene to this page, for you to look upon as
well as read of, for a sight of that face with its surroundings,
would do you good. It would make you yearn after the
blessed opportunity of holding the cup of cold water to other
fevered lips, lighting up other angelic, happy, thankful
smiles.</p>

<p>As it is, the artist has only been able to give you a faint
illustration of the principal features of this scene. So far as it
goes, you cannot but admire his skill&mdash;admire the delineator's
art, by which the picture is sketched upon the block, and the
engraver's skill, who cuts the lines by which the printer spreads
the scene out before the admiring eyes of those who read and
view. Such is art, and skill, and industry. How much better
than the idle life of those who furnished the originals for these
"Life Scenes!"</p>

<p>Vainly we pleaded with the mother of Madalina to carry her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to a comfortable room&mdash;to my house&mdash;to any house&mdash;to the
hospital&mdash;to get a physician&mdash;a nurse&mdash;some one, at least, to
give her a drink of cold water through the next long, long
day, when she would be left nearly alone&mdash;perhaps quite so&mdash;locked
in this dreadful room&mdash;while men and monkeys, organs
and tambourines, beggers and rag-pickers, were all away plying
their trades in the streets of the city. It was no use; she was
inexorable. The <i>padre</i> was a very good doctor&mdash;the <i>padre</i>
was good for her soul&mdash;the <i>padre</i> would pray for her; and if
she was to die, she should not die in the house of a heretic.
So we parted. It was a hard parting, for she clung to each
one as she said:</p>

<p>"Good bye; I wish I could go with you, but my mother&mdash;you
have taught me to obey my mother, that all good children
obey their mothers&mdash;so good bye&mdash;good bye, Tom. You
will bring me another drink to-morrow? yes, I knew you
would, if I asked you, you are so good to me."</p>

<p>There were tears at parting, and they were not all tears of
a sick child, or good boy, but strong men wept.</p>

<p>"Tom," said the feeble, sobbing voice, after we had almost
reached the door, over the careless sleepers on the floor;
"Tom, come back a minute, I want to&mdash;want to&mdash;say&mdash;what
if I should not see you again? I want to send something to Mrs.
Pease; she was so kind to me; I wish I had something to
send her to remember me by; but I have got nothing&mdash;nothing.
Yes, I will send her a&mdash;a little nearer."</p>

<p>And she put her arms around his neck, and imprinted a
kiss upon his lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, I will send her that, it is all I have&mdash;it will tell her
I love her, for I never kiss any but those I love."</p>

<p>Poor Madalina! Poor Tom! What must have been his
feelings at that moment, with the kiss of that angelic, dying
girl burning upon his lips, and running streams of lava down
into his young heart, while these words, "I never kiss any but
those I love," are thrilling through his brain like words of fire?</p>

<p>What he felt I cannot tell. I will not tell what I felt after
the first flow of scalding tears had passed away, but I fear
there was an unforgiving spirit in my heart; and if the foot
which crashed that tender flower had been there then, perhaps
it and its fellow had not carried their moving power, the
head, "this side up with care." Perhaps that head would
have been pitched headlong down these long, steep, dark, and
narrow stairs, to the pavement&mdash;less hard than its guiding
heart.</p>

<p>"We must not kill," said Tom, as we reached the street.</p>

<p>Had he divined my secret thoughts, or was it the response
to his own?</p>

<p>"We must not kill those who sell the rum, or kick little
children to death, or make brutes of their mothers, but we
will kill the business, or else we will prove that all are not
good men in this world who pretend to be."</p>

<p>"It is greatly changed," I said to the Missionary, as we
came down upon the street, "since you have lived here; as it
was some years ago, when I first knew this locality, it might
not have been quite safe to walk alone through these streets at
this midnight hour; now we have no fear. Good night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be better two years hence, if you and I live.
Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night. Heaven protect you, and bless your labors.
Good night, Tom."</p>

<p>But Tom heard me not. "I never kiss any but those I love,"
was ringing in his ears. He heard nothing&mdash;thought of
nothing else. Poor Tom! He carried a heavy heart to a
sleepless bed that night.</p>

<p>Back, up Anthony to Centre, then along that one block, and
I stood and contemplated that great sombre, gray stone building
which fills a whole square, looking down gloomily upon
the multitude who reek in misery on the opposite side of the
street, or pursue their nefarious schemes of crime within the
very shadow of "the Tombs." Alas! prisons prevent not
crime, nor does incarceration work reformation upon such as
dwell in tenements such as we have just visited.</p>

<p>"It is but a step from the palace to the tomb."</p>

<p>True, and so it seemed this night; for ere I had fairly
realized the fact that I had passed over the short step of two
squares between the City prison&mdash;the Tombs&mdash;and Broadway,
I stood looking into that great palace hall on the corner of
Franklin street, known as Taylor's Saloon.</p>

<p>Was ever eating and drinking temptation more gorgeously
fitted up? How the gilt and carving, and elaborate skill of
the painter's art glitter in the more than sun-light splendor of
a hundred sparkling gas-burners. Are the windows open?
No. The ten-feet long plates of glass are so clear from speck,
it seems as though it were open space. Look in. It is midnight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Is all still? Do the tired servants sleep? No. They
are flitting up and down, with noiseless tread, to furnish late
suppers and health-destroying luxuries, to a host of men and
gayly dressed women. 'Tis the palace of luxury&mdash;'tis but
a step from the palace to the tombs&mdash;'tis but a step beyond to
the home of "the Rag Picker's Daughter"&mdash;'tis here that the
first step is taken which leads to infamy like that of that
daughter's mother. 'Tis here that he, whose trade is seduction,
walketh unshamed at noonday, or prowls at midnight, to
select his victims. 'Tis here that mothers suffer young daughters
to come at this untimely midnight hour to drink "light
wines," or eat ice cream, drugged with passion-exciting vanilla.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the fiend as we passed, on, "rag-picking
mothers are not the only ones who traffic away the
virtue of young daughters in this rum-flooded city."</p>

<p>"What," said I, as I passed on, "if all the mis-spent shillings,
worse than wasted in this palace, were dropped into the
treasury of the House of Industry?"</p>

<p>"Cow Bay, Farlow's Court, and Rotten Row, would be no
more, and my occupation would be gone," said the fiend. "It
must not be. Dry up rum, and murder would cease and
misery have no home here. It must not be. <i>Our</i> trade is in
danger; I must alarm my friends!"</p>

<p>And he clattered his cloven foot down the steps of a nearby
cellar, where there were loud sounds of blasphemous
words, the noise of jingling glasses, and much wrangling,
amid which I heard female voices in one of the "private
rooms," and then an order for more wine&mdash;then I heard old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
cloven foot say, "give them a bottle of two-and-sixpenny
cider, they are so drunk now they wont know the odds."</p>

<p>Then I understood why the fiend said "our trade"&mdash;it is
one which none else than such delight in.</p>

<p>I listened again. There was an awful string of oaths
coming up out of the infernal regions, where men and women&mdash;street-walkers&mdash;were
getting drunk upon alcohol, carbonic
acid, and cider, mixed into three dollar bottles of "wine"&mdash;pure
champagne.</p>

<p>"Give me my pocket-book, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I cannot repeat the horrid expletives. Why does a man
call a woman with whom he associates, such vile names?
Why does the woman retort upon him that he is the son of a
female dog, and call upon God to send his soul to perdition?
Because they have "tarried long at the wine; have looked
upon it when it is red, when it giveth its color in the cup."
Now "it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder."</p>

<p>Now the woman has picked the pocket of her male companion&mdash;I
cannot say gentleman; now he utters those terrible
oaths; now she pours out such a stream of words as would
pollute the very air where virtue lives; now there is a struggle;
now a man is stabbed by a woman; now there is a crash of
broken glass, a female street-walker is knocked down with a
bottle in the hands of a man who has picked her up, and
whose pockets she has picked; surely it was no vision of the
brain that fancied we saw the incarnate fiend go down there;
now there is a cry of murder; now there is a rapping of clubs
upon the pavement, and running of men with brass stars upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the left breast of their coats; now the police bear up a
wounded man&mdash;if, Madalina was here her wounded breast
would ache with new pain&mdash;she is avenged at last; now they
drag up a woman, a young girl, on her way to the Tombs&mdash;it
is Julia Antrim.</p>

<p>Drop the curtain. Surely you would not look into a
prison cell, or go into the police court, or with a "vagrant,"
not yet fourteen years old, to Randall's Island. In some
change of the scene you may see her again. <i>Quien sabe?</i></p>

<p>"It was late next morning," said Mr. Pease, "when I woke
up, and then I lay in a sort of dreamy reverie, thinking what
a world of good I could do if I had plenty of means, until
near ten o'clock. Finally, I heard an uneasy step outside my
door and at length it seemed to venture to approach, and then
there was a timid rap."</p>

<p>"May I come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom, come in. What is it, Tom?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I want to go away to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Tom, don't go away to-day, you remember what
you promised to do for Madalina."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I am going to do it. I am going to see
where they put her, and then I will plant a flower there, and
I will water it too, and that is not all, either, that I am going
to do with water before I die. I am going to teach people to
drink it, and not drink rum."</p>

<p>"Going to see where they put her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Tom, do I understand you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, sir, she did."</p>

<p>"Tell me, my boy, what you mean. You seem a little
wild, your eyes are very red. Did you sleep any last night?"</p>

<p>"Sleep! could you sleep, with those words ringing in your
ears all night? Her last words&mdash;she never spoke again."</p>

<p>"By this time I had reached the window. I looked out.
There was a 'poor house hearse' in Cow Bay. A little
coffin was brought down and put in, and it moved away. It
carried the Rag-picker's Daughter."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="h3">ATHALIA, THE SEWING GIRL.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oftentimes, to win us to our harm,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The instruments of darkness tell us truths:<br></span>
<span class="i0">"Win us with honest trifles, to betray us<br></span>
<span class="i0">In deepest consequence."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the close of chapter nine, we left Athalia standing by
the side of her trunk and bandbox on the sidewalk, in front
of her now empty home. After paying up the rent, and a
few outstanding little bills, she had but a scanty store left in
her little purse. Of this she set apart, as a sacred deposit,
almost the entire sum, to redeem her Bible and watch&mdash;the
locket at any rate. Now she wished she could see Nannette,
for she was the only instrument she knew, that she could
employ in the negociation. She could not go where she lived,
for fear of meeting Walter, whom she had determined never
to see again. She had sent for a hack to take her away, she
really knew not where. She had but few, except business
acquaintances in the city; none upon whom she felt willing
to call in her emergency. She felt so cast down, that she
could not look one of them in the face. She had made up
her mind to go to a hotel for the night, and leave the city in
the morning; whither she knew not; anywhere to get away,
Then she thought that she could not go without seeing Nannette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and making an effort to regain her valued keepsakes
How should she see her? what should she do?</p>

<p>It is an old proverb, "Wish for the devil and he will appear."
Just then a carriage drove up and stopped where she stood.
She was so certain it was the one she had sent for, that she
did not observe that it contained two ladies, until the driver
had opened the door, and one of them spoke.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Morgan, are you going away? How unfortunate.
I wanted three or four dresses made. When will you
be back?"</p>

<p>When? How could she tell, since she did not know where
she was going? She was in a fever of excitement to go somewhere,
to get away before Walter should come. She felt as
though it would kill her to see him then.</p>

<p>All day she had been calm; she had found it absolutely
necessary, in order to keep herself so, to drink two or three
glasses of wine. If it had been wine, such as the fermented
juice of grapes will make, it had not done her material harm;
but it was such as is made in this city, or "got up" expressly
for this market; and she began to feel the effects of the
alcohol it contained dying away. She felt as though she was
dying, too. She did not, therefore, hesitate long, or refuse the
pressing invitation of Mrs. Laylor to go home with her and
stay all night. Although she began to suspect the character
of Mrs. Laylor's house, she did not know it, or her either, or
she would have spent the night where she stood rather than
in her best room.</p>

<p>She was still further induced to go, when she found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
her companion was Nannette. True, there was a flash, a mere
flash of thought across her mind, why so common a woman
as Nannette should be in the carriage of so reserved a lady;
one who, if she was guilty of slight improprieties herself
would not be suspected for the world, and had no charity for
the inmates of houses in M&mdash;&mdash; street.</p>

<p>Little thought Athalia, that Nannette, when she visited
Mrs. Laylor's, passed for "a very respectable married lady, who
would not be known for anything&mdash;it would ruin her;" or
else, when dressed in deep mourning, with a thick veil over
her face, which nothing could induce her to remove, was a
"very interesting young widow, of one of the first families in
the city, who was obliged, by necessity, to accept the love of
a gentleman&mdash;a married gentleman&mdash;who visited her house,
but would not make the acquaintance of any woman except
one in just such a condition as this 'sweet young
widow.'"</p>

<p>I know, I speak it boldly, a woman now living in this city,
in up-town style, upon money obtained from six dupes, every
one of whom she had "on a string" at the same time, and
some of whom she used to meet at that very house, under just
such guises. I say it, still more boldly and truly, for "old
sores must be seen to be healed," that she has thus duped the
whole six in one day. I know the woman&mdash;I know five of
the dupes, and that each one of them has a wife. Two
wear the title of Judge; one deals in flour; one in dry goods;
and one has another employment I dare not speak so boldly
of, for the sake of his children and unsuspecting wife. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
drives fast horses, and truth, might drive a good woman to
despair.</p>

<p>Athalia little suspected all this; still less did she suspect
that she had been watched all day; that her order for a carriage
even had been intercepted, and Mrs. Laylor had come
in its stead. She did not know then that the stable owner
was the paramour of Mrs. Laylor, and Nannette the pimp of
this most dangerous woman&mdash;dangerous, because she struck
her game, both male and female, out of the upper class of
society, giving them a fair start on the road down to a cellar
in Cow Bay.</p>

<p>We have seen one of the Morgan family that she started
on that course, who run a swift race. She is now fishing for
another&mdash;already has her in her net, for she has ordered
Cato to put up the baggage&mdash;already has Athalia seated by
her side, condoling with her in her afflictions, giving her sweet
sympathy, telling her a few truths and many lies&mdash;"instruments
of darkness" win by such&mdash;wondering how she could
have lived with her bad husband so long as she had, when
she could live so much better&mdash;"<i>by the needle</i>"&mdash;without such
a man. She does not propose another now&mdash;of course not;
she will bide her time for that, when all her plots have
ripened the seed she is now sowing.</p>

<p>They were soon at home; before Athalia had half done
telling how fearful she was of meeting Walter, and how she
wanted to get out of town before he discovered her; and then
Mrs. Laylor told her how very private she could be at her
house&mdash;she would give her the third floor back room, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
send her meals up to her, and she need not see a single soul
but Nannette and herself, besides the chamber-maid&mdash;"none
but your best friends."</p>

<p>Why did Mrs. Laylor whisper Nannette, and why did she
run in the basement way, and why did they have to wait ten
minutes for the door to be opened? And where was
Athalia's thick veil, with which she had intended to hide her
face so that no one would see her, for the excitement of the
day had flushed her cheeks, and made her fascinatingly beautiful,
and she had no desire to expose it to tempt the passion
of any one who might chance to meet her?</p>

<p>"Where can my veil be, I am sure I had it in my hand
when I got in the carriage?"</p>

<p>"I cannot see; perhaps Nannette has gathered it up with
her shawl."</p>

<p>So she had. It had been slipped into the folds of it on
purpose, for Mrs. Laylor was already working her plans, and
counting the hundred dollars that she was going to charge
some rich fool for bringing about a meeting with "one of the
handsomest women in the city&mdash;a dress-maker, fresh from the
country." In furtherance of this object of a wicked woman,
in pursuit of gain, she had sent Nannette into the house, to
station one of her dupes where he could see, without being
seen, the unveiled face of Athalia, as she passed in, and
up the stairs. For this purpose, the usually dark hall had
been lighted, and the veil stolen.</p>

<p>"None but friends," there.</p>

<p>The victim that Nannette went to put in place, was a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
clergyman, like other men in the vigor of youth, possessed of
like passions. He would have sought a wife, but his salary
would not support one in the style that she would demand, or
his congregation expect their pastor to maintain; and so he
sought indulgence where he had found out accidentally that
some of the members of his own church had sought it for
themselves.</p>

<p>He had slipped in, with handkerchief over his face, just
before Mrs. Laylor went out. She told him that she was
going to the railroad depot to meet a young woman from the
country, a dress-maker, whom she had sent for, to come and
make a few dresses for her and "my daughter," as she
unblushingly, called Nannette, who, she said, "had been
away from home, at school."</p>

<p>The words were true, yet the speech was a lie, a wicked lie,
made to deceive one who had been unwary enough to put his
finger in a trap. She had been away from home, a home
where she left a mother, and brothers, and sisters. And she
had been at school&mdash;a school where language and manners
are taught; but, oh! what language, and what ways, and
manners. It is a school which is computed to have thirty
thousand teachers in this city.</p>

<p>What strange inconsistencies our human nature is possessed
of. This Nannette had naturally a good heart. We saw that
in the scene where Mrs. Morgan discovers the depth of
depravity to which one of those teachers had dragged down
her husband. Yet, no sooner is Athalia placed by misfortune
in a position to be subject to temptation, than she offers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
her gratuitous services to Mrs. Laylor, to effect her complete
ruin. What for? Who can answer? I cannot, unless the
fable of the fox that lost his tail in a trap, will give a cue to
the solution. I fear, that we are too apt to wish others no
better than ourselves. It must have been some such motive
that actuated Nannette: the little pecuniary advantage
offered by Mrs. Laylor for her assistance, does not seem to be
a sufficient motive for one female, though she herself has lost
the priceless jewel of female virtue, to wish to bring another
of her sex into that vortex which engulfs all who come
within its m&auml;elstrom power, as certain as that upon the
Norway coast. Be the motive what it may, she had certainly
lent herself this day, as a willing tool, to do a double
deed of wrong.</p>

<p>I cannot name the clergyman who was to be made&mdash;had
been made&mdash;the victim in this nefarious plot, because he is
still living, and has paid the penalty of ruined health for
visiting such a house, and a still greater penalty of a gnawing
conscience for the sin, and the lies told to cover it up.</p>

<p>As a <i>nom de plume</i>, I will call him, Otis, because it is the
most dissimilar to his own, of any one I can think of.</p>

<p>Otis had been tempted to visit this house, as I said before,
by a natural strong passion, but that would have been insufficient,
had not a sort of Paul Pry friend told him of the
delinquency of one of his flock, and urged him to watch him.
He did so, saw him enter the house with a woman, certainly
not his wife, charged him afterwards, with a view to his reformation,
and was met with a plump denial of the character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the place, and even threatened with exposure of his attempt
to watch and pry into other peoples' business. Goaded with
such an accusation, he retorted upon his informer, and he in
his turn reiterated the charge, and urged Otis to "call on a
professional (that is pastoral) visit," and satisfy himself.</p>

<p>This he did, and found the house most genteelly and richly
furnished; the owner, "a widow, living," she said, "upon the
interest of money in bank,"&mdash;she meant the interest of
bankers' money&mdash;a very modest, genteel lady, very much
pleased to have him call, and begged him to repeat the visit
"some afternoon or evening when the young ladies, her
nieces and daughter, would be at home, and if he was fond
of music, they would play for him, and one of them could
sing beautifully." She could sing the "Mermaid's song."
He was completely deceived. Who might not be by such a
siren? The truth is, that her penetrating eye had seen at a
glance quite down into his very secret thoughts, and that he
possessed passions which she could inflame and turn to
account, and she laid all her plans to that end. Although
satisfied, after one or two visits, that all the inmates of the
house were correct, he had his suspicions aroused as to those
who visited them, for he could not help noticing the fact, that
while he was there one evening, there were no less than five
calls, apparently of couples, who were received in a dark hall,
with whispered words, and then went upstairs, and after
awhile went out in the same quiet way. Twice, he saw
through the crack of the door that the ladies were veiled with
thick dark veils, such as we meet every day upon the Broadway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
side-walk. But the most convincing thing of all, was
an incautious word spoken aloud by one of the visitors as
Mrs. Laylor was letting him out. He knew the voice. It
was the man whose conduct had led him first to this house.
Then he was so well satisfied, that he told Mrs. Laylor his
suspicions, and she acknowledged that she did sometimes let
a room to a gentleman and lady, but to none except persons
of the highest respectability, such as himself, for instance.
That was a cue. He took it and fell into the snare. She
agreed "for a consideration," to introduce him to one of the
most respectable ladies, upon the understanding that she was
to remain closely veiled,&mdash;as the whole proceeding was to be
veiled from the Argus eyes of the world.</p>

<p>The "respectable lady" was drawn from the same house
to which we have before had an introduction; in short,
she was the same "lady" in whose room Athalia saw her
husband from Nannette's room. With Otis she played the
part of "clergyman's widow," and for that purpose always
dressed in deep mourning, just as her sisters in sin do now
every day in the fashionable promenades of this city; and she
played it well, until one night, after having taken one bottle
extra between them, for he had not yet learned that wine
drinking was but little better than whiskey drinking, "she let
out on him," in such a manner that his eyes were opened, and
he determined to leave the house. But he had tasted sin, and
who that has, but well knows how much harder it is afterwards
to resist the temptation?</p>

<p>So he came back. What an excuse he made to conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
as he did so!&mdash;That it was only to upbraid the woman for
deceiving him. He deceived himself. First, in trusting himself
in a deceitful woman's power; and, secondly, in supposing
that after she had deceived him once, she would not again.
This last visit was upon the very night in which Athalia was
introduced into the house, and hence the lies to inflame his
mind, and the art made use of to give him a stolen glance of
her face.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that the first man fell, when "tempted of a
woman." It is idle to talk of our power to withstand their
seductive arts. Otis was entrapped again. The sight of
Athalia's beauty inflamed his already wine-heated blood, and
he readily offered Mrs. Laylor a hundred dollars to bring
about a successful negociation. This was just what she
intended&mdash;what she expected&mdash;she had baited her trap high,
and the game was already caught. And he was not the only
one she intended to catch with the same bait. She intended
to use her as a profitable investment upon all her "regular
customers"&mdash;for all such houses boast of such&mdash;as long as she
could make the lie of "fresh from the country," pass as current
coin. She little thought, and cared less, how many lies
she had to contrive and tell Athalia, before she could accomplish
her purpose. It does seem as though, when a woman
loses her own virtue, that she imagines all her sex have lost
or would lose theirs just as easy as herself.</p>

<p>"I drag down," should be graven upon the brow of every
one of her class. Whether man or woman, whoever comes
within their influence&mdash;and who does not, since they are permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to go forth at noonday through the thoroughfares of
this city, seeking whom they may devour, and all night long
they show their brazen faces in the streets, "picking up" poor
fools for victims, whom they drag down&mdash;true, they go willingly&mdash;to
their dens of destruction.</p>

<p>It does seem as though when a man loses his balance so far
as to fall into the influence of such a woman, that he is "ready
to believe a lie even unto his own damnation." How else
could Walter Morgan&mdash;there are a great many Walter Morgans&mdash;leave
such a wife as Athalia for such a Jezebel as he
did? How else did such a man as Otis, whose business it
was to watch the fold, allow the wolf to enter and carry off
the shepherd? Why, after he had found out how much he
had been cheated, did he believe the lies of the cheat again?
Who can answer? I cannot. I can only say, that in this
branch of intoxication, the only safe rule is that of the teetotaller,
"touch not, taste not, handle not;" and it must be more
rigidly applied in the one case than the other. A man may
possibly touch liquor and drink not. Can he play with a
harlot and not fall? Otis should have preached a sermon,
not to his congregation, but to his own conscience in his own
closet, from this text:</p>

<blockquote><p>"For a whore is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a
narrow pit.</p>

<p>"She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
transgressions among men."</p></blockquote>

<p>She certainly had increased the transgressions in the case
of Otis, and she lay in wait for Athalia as a prey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Otis would have sought an introduction immediately, for
wine had mastered reason; wine, that is made expressly for
such houses, had inflamed his blood.</p>

<p>This the master-piece of iniquity knew would never answer.
But she promised him that for the sum named, she would
bring about the desired interview.</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At least she would try."</p>

<p>"To-night or never! To-night is the last night that I shall
ever set foot in your house. I have registered a vow in heaven
to that, and I will keep it."</p>

<p>So he did. He had good cause to remember that night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laylor saw that he looked as though he intended to
keep it, and as he had been fool enough to tell her so, she at
once determined to fool him to her own profit. So she promised
him that he should have his utmost desire, and upon
that she ordered up another bottle of wine, urged him to drink
and amuse himself with the young ladies, while she went up
and "smoothed the way."</p>

<p>There is but little need of smoothing the way that leads
nearly every young man, who visits such places, to destruction.
But she had a way to smooth. It was her last chance with
this victim, and she determined on profit and revenge.</p>

<p>In due time she came in, and reported favorably.</p>

<p>"The lady would see him, in consideration of his profession,
upon one condition&mdash;that he would not seek to learn her
name, or anything about her, and that he should not see her
face."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>What did he care for that, since he had already seen it,
and it was daguerreotyped upon his heated imagination, so
that he would know her whenever he should meet her afterwards
in the street.</p>

<p>Let the curtain of night fall. The sun shone into an eastern
window of No. &mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;n street the next morning, while
Otis still slept. Its bright rays awakened him to the startling
consciousness of having over-slept himself after a night of
debauch. How should he get away without being seen?
The thought troubled him sorely. But he soon determined
what he would do; he would steal the veil from the face of
the sleeping beauty to hide his own, and then slip out by the
basement door, perhaps unseen. What harm could it do to
her, since he had seen and knew the face so well?</p>

<p>He dressed himself hurriedly, then gently drew the veil
away, with a salvo to his conscience that he would not then
see her face, he would look the other way. His conscience
would have been more easy afterwards if he had kept that
resolve. He could not. The glance at Athalia's beauty the
night before had maddened him, and he turned, as he was
going out of the door, to look back where she slept, and steal&mdash;"Thou
shalt not steal"&mdash;he had forgotten that&mdash;steal one
more glance. He did, but instead of the face of Athalia, he
saw that of a common street-walker&mdash;a young harridan&mdash;and
he rushed from the room with the full weight of a burning
conscience for his folly, with a feeling of self-degradation at
being victimized a second time by the same deceitful woman;
hating himself and everybody else; dreading to meet any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
he knew, and, finally, encountering in the basement hall,
striving to get out in the same sly way, the very man whom
he had first taken to task for visiting this den of infamy.
What a recognition! Neither could speak, so intense was
the thought in the mind of each that the other might ruin
him by simply revealing the truth. Strange that neither
thought how little the other would dare to speak, least it
should be inquired, "How did you know he was there?
Where was you?"</p>

<p>Otis said afterwards to an acquaintance of mine, a physician,
whom he was obliged to consult in consequence of that
sinful night, that he could not conceive any agony more
intensely painful in this life than that which he endured the
next Sabbath, when he arose in the pulpit and looked down
upon the congregation, but saw nothing, could see nothing,
but that one pair of eyes glaring upon him just as they did
the morning he met them in the hall of that house where he
had been so disgraced.</p>

<p>"I little knew then," said he, "as I did afterwards, that he
felt just as bad as I did, for he told me that it seemed to him
that I was about to denounce him to the whole congregation.
So intense had this feeling become, that he was on the point
of seizing his hat and rushing out when the words burst from
my lips, 'if thou knowest aught of thy brother's failing, cover
it up from the rude gaze of the world, for it can profit them
nothing to know of his faults.'</p>

<p>"'Go to him privately and speak kindly, and he will reform!'
So he did, to our mutual benefit."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>This relieved the mind of Otis, but it did not save him from
the sad effect of a poisoned, neglected system, but it cured
him from visiting places where he was ashamed to show his
face. It taught him that "the way of the transgressor is
hard." He had one more trial. He had not paid Mrs.
Laylor the hundred dollars promised while heated with wine,
for he felt that she was not entitled to it, and he had no such
sum to spare. Late one Saturday night he received a note
from the lady, requesting immediate payment, and threatening
exposure in church the next day if he failed to make it
instanter. He had not so much money in the world, and knew
no way by which he could get it immediately. He was in
an agony of fear all the evening. The only man to whom
he dared apply either for money or advice, the man who was
equally guilty, was out of town. What should he do? He
did what every Christian should do. He opened his Bible,
and the first words, that his eyes fell upon were, "ask and it
shall be given you."</p>

<p>He did ask, and ask earnestly, what shall I do? Before he
had done asking, the door bell rang and a letter marked
"private&mdash;by express," was laid upon his table. A glance at
the superscription told him it was from the man he was so
anxious to see.</p>

<p>He opened and read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend Otis</span>,<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p><p>"I have had a sort of presentiment upon my mind that you
were about to be distressed for that hundred dollars, and as I am well
aware that you never would have been placed in jeopardy if I had not
first done wrong, I beg you to accept the enclosed check for that
amount.</p>

<p>"I need not say who it is from."</p></blockquote>

<p>How strange, how opportune, how quick the answer to his
asking had come back. What a load it lifted off his mind.
It is not the first load that prayer, earnest, sincere prayer, has
lifted. He was relieved in more ways than one; he had
repented of his folly, and had become a better and a wiser
man. Gold is refined of its adhering dross by fire. Otis still
lives, and every day he warns some one, not only of the folly
and sin, but the danger, of visiting that class of houses, if only
from curiosity. They are all traps for the unwary, and gulfs
into which the soul sinks blindfold down to perdition.</p>

<p>We have lost sight of Athalia. Let us return to her&mdash;she
will need all our sympathy, for she stands upon the very
brink of a precipice, over which though many have fallen,
few ever returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laylor manifested the greatest sympathy for Athalia
that one friend could for another. She gave her the most
private room in the house, and assured her that she should be
welcome to it just as long as she pleased; "but of course,"
she said, "you will not remain a moment, after you get your
things from that wicked woman. Now what can I do to
assist you?"</p>

<p>This was said in such a kind, sympathizing manner, that a
more suspicious mind than hers might have been deceived;
and she answered, "Oh, you can do a good deal. I am
afraid to go out, particularly to go to that house, or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
woman, and I want my keepsakes. I have got seventy
dollars, and I will give it freely if I can get them again."</p>

<p>She did not see the glisten of the eye, or the avaricious
clutch of the hand, as that miserly woman thought, "I will
have that." She only heard the soft tones of her voice as she
said, "my dear Mrs. Morgan, I will take it and see what I
can do, but I am really afraid it is not sufficient to induce her
to part with them, as you say they are actually worth more
money."</p>

<p>"What shall I do then? I feel as though I could not part
with them, and in such a way too, that is worse than all. I
would have sacrificed them in a moment for that man, if he
had been sick and suffering, for want of food or medicine."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear friend, do not worry yourself. Remember
that you have friends, kind sympathizing friends, who
will do more for you than they would for themselves. I will
go directly and see what can be done if you will give me the
money."</p>

<p>So she did, and by dint of threats, and coaxing, and
promises to Josephine, to try and get something out of "the
poor fool's wife," for her, she gave them up, and Mrs. Laylor,
before night, had them safely locked in her own iron chest.</p>

<p>"Why did she not give them to Athalia at once?"</p>

<p>Simply, because she intended to keep both money and
things. So she told Athalia, that Josephine had not yet
returned from Coney Island, where she knew she had gone
with her husband, wearing her watch, passing for his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
spending her money, which he had collected for the making
of the dress that he had stolen away without her knowledge.</p>

<p>But she had come back; where was Walter?</p>

<p>Somewhere with his set. He had not yet dared to face his
injured wife. He intended to skulk home late at night. In
the evening he went to see his dear, sweet, amiable mistress.
She was in about the same state of mind after Mrs. Laylor
left her, that a female tiger would be, on arriving at her lair,
after a little pleasure excursion, in which she might have
killed a couple of Indian children, but was driven off before
her appetite for blood was satisfied, and now found that some
other equally ferocious animal had despoiled her of her own
young.</p>

<p>Walter and she had had "a good time" together, and parted
lovingly only a few hours before. How he was surprised as
he entered her room carelessly, to hear her tell him with a
terrible oath&mdash;oaths are ten times more terrible in woman's
than in man's mouth&mdash;to leave the room or she would take
his life. At first, he thought she was in sport. One look
was enough to convince him of his error. Then he thought
she was mad, because he had entered without knocking, and
found her engaged in dressing for the evening debauch and
usual scenes of dissipation, and began to rally her on her
Eve-like appearance.</p>

<p>That was more than some more amiable women can bear.
No matter how ill dressed or undressed, a woman does not
like to be rallied on her personal appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>It was more than such a human tiger could, or would bear.
She darted at him, and proceeded vigorously in the task of
reducing him to the same state, so far as his toilet was concerned,
as herself. It did not take long. First, she crushed
his hat. His dress coat was fine, and it was tender, for it
was old, and she tore it into ribbons, in an instant. His vest
and shirt followed, and she made vigorous efforts at the
remaining garment, and then he broke and ran from the wild
fury. She overtook him at the top of the stairs, gave
him a vigorous kick that sent him, naked and insensible,
down to the lower hall, where he was picked up by the
police, and carried to the station house; there he had his
bruises attended to, and there he would have got a passport
to "the Island," only that he happened to be known, and
when he told where he lived, one of the officers said, that
was the fact, that he knew his wife, and a most excellent
woman she was, and it would be a pity, on her account, to
send him up this time, and so he volunteered to go home
with him, and get some clothes and see what his wife wanted
done with him. Walter found his trunk and all that he could
claim as his own&mdash;it was not much, hardly enough for present
necessity&mdash;where Athalia had left it, in the next-door shop,
and there he learned the facts about the sale, and his wife
going off in a carriage with two ladies, and a Negro driver;
but he did not learn why she had gone, he needed no words
to tell him that, a monitor within spoke louder than words.</p>

<p>"A guilty conscience needs no accuser."</p>

<p>What should he do? It is easy to say what a man should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
do. He should go and find his wife, and fall down upon his
knees; yes, bow his face into the dust, pray for forgiveness,
and promise reform. And he would be forgiven. That is
woman's nature. The Forgiver of all sins, is not more forgiving.</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>That is just as easy said. He sold his last good shirt&mdash;one
that his wife had just made&mdash;to procure the means of
getting drunk.</p>

<p>"What a pity that there should be any places where such
a man could get liquor; or that such places, if they do exist,
should be kept by wretches who will take the shirt off the
back of the poor inebriate for rum."</p>

<p>Yes, it is a pity. It is the cause of ruin of more men than
all other causes.</p>

<p>From this last fall Walter never recovered. He went down,
step by step, to the final termination of almost every young
man who surrenders his reason to such vile influences. You
heard Reagan say what that end was. Let his epitaph be,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Requiescat in Pace."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>With various excuses, Athalia was kept in daily expectation
of recovering her property, until continued disappointment
made her heart sick. In vain she begged for something
to do. Everyday it was promised, and every day the promise
broken. She was kept from going out of the house by continual
tales about her husband watching it day after day, and
night after night. Of course this was all sham. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
been told that she had gone out of town, and he believed
it; he never got sober enough to think of inquiring or caring
whether she was dead or alive.</p>

<p>Finally, when Athalia could not be kept any longer upon
such lying promises, Mrs. Laylor told her "that she had finally
got Josephine to consent to give up the watch, and chain, and
locket, and the Bible, for a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Where was the poor girl to get the other thirty. She
knew it was more than they were worth to anybody else, but
she felt as though she would give it freely if she had it. To
add to her distress of mind, just at this time she overheard a
conversation in the next room between Mrs. Laylor and one
of the girls&mdash;it was got up on purpose&mdash;to this effect:</p>

<p>"To be sure she will pay for her board. Of course she
cannot expect to have the best room in the house ten weeks
for nothing. But I shall only charge her seven dollars a
week."</p>

<p>"Seven dollars!" thought Athalia; "that takes the whole
of my seventy dollars, and my watch and Bible still remain
in the hands of that red-headed&mdash;&mdash;Oh, dear! what shall I
do?"</p>

<p>The two continued their conversation.</p>

<p>"But, Aunt, you have promised to give that seventy dollars,
and thirty more with it, to redeem her traps; how are you
going to get seventy dollars more? or if you take that for her
board, and let the watch go, what is she going to do in future?
she has got no money, and don't work any."</p>

<p>"Don't work any," thought she. "How can I work shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
up here? I would work, if I had it to do. I could have
earned that sum before this time." And again she said "Oh
dear! what shall I do?"</p>

<p>It was just what they wanted she should say. Mrs. Laylor
replied:</p>

<p>"Do! Why, she must do what other folks have to do.
Frank Barkley is dying to do for her, the fool that she is; he
would give her any amount of money, if she would be a little
more agreeable when he calls. It was a long time before I
could persuade her to drink a glass of wine with him. Some
girls would have helped me to sell two or three bottles every
evening. I shall tell her to-day that she has got to do something.
I cannot keep anybody in the house this way much
longer."</p>

<p>What a dose of gall and wormwood was this to poor Athalia!
This was boasted friendship. Forced by one specious
pretence after another to remain; purposely kept without work,
that she might get in debt, for that would put her in her
creditor's power; and robbed of her money&mdash;worse than
robbed; and yet she was only served just as innumerable poor
girls have been served before, and will be again; it was
enough to make her cry out, "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>And then to be accused of being ungrateful. That was
worse than all. Then she thought that perhaps she had been.
Mrs. Laylor had told her several times how much wine some
girls could induce gentlemen to buy, and how much profit she
made upon every bottle; and more than that, she had hinted
very strongly how much money such a handsome woman as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Athalia could make, if she was disposed to; and then she told
a story about a young clergyman that used to come there, and
what a great fool he was when he drank a little wine, and
how she made a hundred dollars out of the simpleton, and a
great deal more; but she did not tell her how she cheated
him, nor how she had cheated Athalia out of her seventy
dollars, nor that Frank Barkley had paid her board, which
she was now trumping up an account for, so as to drive her to
the seeming necessity of selling her body and soul to escape
from the tangled web which this human spider was weaving
around this poor weak fly.</p>

<p>In the course of the day, after this overheard conversation,
Mrs. Laylor came to tell Athalia "that she had succeeded at
last in obtaining her watch and Bible, by paying thirty dollars
out of her own pocket, although she did not know how in
the world to spare it, but she supposed Mrs. Morgan would
repay it almost immediately."</p>

<p>Repay it! How could she? And so she said bitterly that
she had no hope. Her heart was almost broken. Mrs.
Laylor, of course, condoled with her, soothed her, reassured
her of her pure friendship, took out the watch and put the
chain over her neck, sent down and had the Bible brought
up, and with it a bottle of wine, one of the half brandy sort,
and insisted upon her drinking of it freely, and driving off
the blues; and then, after she had got her into a state of
partial intoxication, and fit for any act of desperation, sent for
Frank Barkley, who had just arrived, to come up to Athalia's
room, and play a game of cards. She had never before consented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to that, but now Mrs. Laylor was there, and she desired
it, and so he came. It had been all previously arranged that
he should, and that he should order another bottle of wine&mdash;mixed
wine&mdash;and then Mrs. Laylor was called out, and went
suddenly, saying as she did so:</p>

<p>"Let the cards lie, I will be back in a minute."</p>

<p>That minute never came. That night was the last of conscious
purity which had so long sustained Athalia through all
her trials.</p>

<p>For the next six months she never allowed herself to think.
She was lost. The instruments of darkness had betrayed her
into the deepest consequences.</p>

<p>The scene shifts.</p>

<p>Shall we see Athalia again?</p>

<p>Wait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>We started in the first chapter of our volume of "Life
Scenes," to take an evening-walk up Broadway. How little
progress we have made. We turned off at Cortland street, to
follow Mrs. Eaton and her children home, and then we went
with the crowd to the fire. Then we came back to listen to
the cry of "Hot Corn, hot corn! here is your nice hot corn,
smoking hot!" that came up in such plaintive music from the
mouth of Little Katy, in the Park. Then we followed her to
her home, and to her grave. What a ramble I have led
you, reader. Occasionally our route has led us back again
and again into this great, broad, main artery of the lower part
of this bustling world, this great moving, living body, called
New York. There are several other broadways in the upper
part of the city. We have but one in the lowest portion of it&mdash;that
is for carriages. There are a good many broadways of
the town, through which pedestrians go, where they "put an
enemy in the mouth to steal away the brains," an enemy</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whose edge is sharper than the sword: whose tongue<br></span>
<span class="i0">Out-venoms all the worms of Nile; whose breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i6">Rides on the winds, and doth belie<br></span>

<span class="i4">Maids, matrons," all in one fell swoop,<br></span>
<span class="i11">To earth struck down.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such a broadway may be seen, nay, must be seen, by all who
enter the great, high, oaken doors of the granite portal of one
of the best of the great Broadway hotels in New York, for
the way is wide open, inviting the weary traveller to enter the
great, dome-shaped "exchange"&mdash;exchange of gold, health,
peace of mind, domestic blessings, for a worm that will gnaw
out the very soul; a worm with teeth, "whose edge is sharper
than the sword."</p>

<p>That granite pile is a creditable ornament to the city. Its
walls have a look of solidity as enduring as the hills. Yet it
contains an element within that has settled the strong built
fabrics of a greater Master Builder than the architect of that
house, down to the very dust, in a few short years, carrying
with it marble palaces and granite walls.</p>

<p>That building was erected by one who sprang, from a class
as lowly as the day laborer who helped to rear its walls, to
almost immeasurable wealth, by a life of industry, free from
the vice or misfortune of drunkenness.</p>

<p>At first it did not contain that great broadway to death. True,
death had his abode there, but he kept in a cave out of sight.
He did not thrust his hideous visage into the face of every
guest, as he does now. The place of his "exchange" was
then a place of green grass and flowers and sparkling fountains,
upon which all the interior windows of that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
caravansery looked down with joy and gladness, smiling o'er
the perfumed atmosphere, and beauty admired beautiful
flowers, and listened to love-inspiring songs of birds, and
pattering of falling water in the great marble basin. Ah!
that was a court, worthy of such a traveller's home. But it
did not produce the profit that flows to the owner through
another liquid channel, where that fountain once leaped,
played and sparkled in the sunshine. Lovely eyes still look
down from the surrounding chamber windows, not upon the
flowers and birds and crystal waters, but upon an unsightly
dome, and in fancy through its roof, and there they see their
husbands, brothers, fathers, friends, putting an enemy in their
mouths to steal away their brains. How fancy will work;
how it will send sharp pangs to the heart; sharper than a
two-edged sword; how the feeble wife will look down upon
that roof, and pray for it to give up her husband. Other
wives have prayed the tomb for the same object, both equally
effective. Both will pray to both again, and both will feel
that hardest of all pangs for a wife to bear, the pang that
tells of a lost husband; lost in one case almost as sure as the
other; the loss more hard to bear, when lost while living,
than when lost by death.</p>

<p>I was sitting, one night, in the corridor of this, with the
exception of its drinking "exchange," really good, well
managed hotel, looking over the balustrade, at the in-coming
and out-going throng, counting the numbers that went rum-ward
as three to one, to those who went up the solid stone
steps, already deeply worn by the constant dropping of feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and trying to read the varied countenances of the ever-changing,
varying scene before me. It is a useful study, to study
our own kind; it is a good place, in the corridor of a great
hotel, to practice. Every now and then, a face beamed out
from the mass which made me sensible that it was not new,
but whether an old acquaintance, or one seen before in some
other crowd, I could not tell. Once only I was sure that the
face which riveted my attention was that of one I had called
friend, yet, for my life, I could not tell when or where. It
was one of those faces which we never forget. It was one
which a child would approach with confidence, to ask for a
favor. It was one, which a stranger in his walk through the
city, would pick out among a hundred, to ask for a direction
to a particular street. Ten chances to one, he would not be
satisfied to give that stranger a direction in words, but would
turn round, and go a little out of the way to show the
inquirer the best route, or stand upon the side-walk until one
of the right line of stages came up so as to be sure that he
went right. There are a few such faces, which go far to
redeem the mass from the charge of coldness or selfishness,
which does seem to be the distinguishing mark of the majority.</p>

<p>I followed this one up the steps, and as far as the vision
extended, as he walked away to one of the parlors. He was
an elderly man, silvering with age, neatly, but plainly dressed,
and I could not help feeling that he looked in everything
about him, as though it would rejoice his very soul to have a
chance to do a good action. I was not mistaken. You will
not be if you read on. I could not sit still after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
passed up. I went into a long train of thought upon the
mental question, the one absorbing question, "Who is he?"
The argument grew intensely painful, and I became so much
absorbed in it, that I almost forgot for a moment where I
was, until I was brought back to consciousness by a little
voice in my ear, of, "Please to buy these, sir." I almost
said, no, without deigning to look up at the quasi beggar, as
the frequency of the question, in all public places, is such
that it is somewhat annoying. But there was a something in
the tone of the voice that sent its magnetic power through
me, and put down that spirit which gives the cold shoulder
to the poor, and bids them "call again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"There is a Providence in all things," many a pious heart
will aspirate, as the truths of this little incident are made
manifest. It does, certainly, seem a little singular that this
little pedlar girl should be the chosen instrument of connexion
between me and that benevolent gentleman, whom I
had been vainly endeavoring to recognise in thought, and
also another character, with which the reader is already
acquainted.</p>

<p>What is there in a word, or tone, the mere sound of the
voice, that sends a stream of magnetic fluid through the system,
to repel or attract the speaker?</p>

<p>What singular means are used to bring about strange
results! I was magnetized by that voice. What the result
was, you shall see. But after the fluid had once entered my
brain, I could no more repel the voice, or its owner, or drive
it away, than the iron can disengage itself from the magnet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
I looked up, and a little girl with a basket upon her arm was
standing by my side, holding up a pair of suspenders while
she uttered the "Please buy these, sir?" close to my ear.
She was a pretty child, between twelve and thirteen years old,
rather precocious in appearance; was neatly dressed, and possessed
of such a mild, sweet voice, that the mocking-bird
might imitate it in his dulcet notes.</p>

<p>I could not say, no, in such tones as would send her away,
and so I replied, pleasantly, "No, my girl, I do not wish to
buy them."</p>

<p>The timid take courage at mild words. Was she too,
attracted by mine? There is magnetism in the human voice.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, you will buy a box of matches?" "No."
"Or a comb." "No." "Oh, do buy something, sir, it is getting
late, and I am so anxious to sell a few shillings' worth
more. Will you buy a pair of gloves? you wear gloves,
don't you? Oh! do let me sell you a pair, you look as
though you would buy something of me if you wanted
anything. Will you buy a shirt collar? There is a nice one,
sir, one that my sick mother made, sir. Will you buy
that?"</p>

<p>"No, my girl, I never wear collars, but I will buy a pair of
gloves, if you will answer me a few questions."</p>

<p>"Will you? Well sir, if they are such as I may answer, I
will, and I don't think you would ask me any other&mdash;some
men do, though."</p>

<p>"That is just one of the questions I wanted to ask you."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I wish you would not ask me what some men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
say to me, it is so bad; only yesterday evening, one very bad
man&mdash;but I cannot tell."</p>

<p>And she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Well, then, don't tell if it distresses you so."</p>

<p>"It won't now, and I want to tell you, because I should
like to let you know what a good man that grey-headed
old gentleman is that came in just before I did."</p>

<p>"What, the one with a gold-headed cane?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a tall man, with a grey frock-coat, and such a
good-looking face."</p>

<p>"Then, I do want you to tell me, if it is anything about
him. I think I have seen him before."</p>

<p>"Then, I hope you will again, for he is one of the real
good men. Well, sir, yesterday evening, I was here, and I
offered to sell some things to a young gentleman, and he
talked so clever, that I felt glad to think how many things
he was going to buy, for he picked out a pair of gloves and
six shirt collars, and several other things, and told me to
come up to his room, and get the money, and I went up; I
did not think it any harm, for I had been up several times
before to gentlemen's rooms, and they never acted bad to me,
but this one did, and I was so frightened that I screamed,
and then he caught me, and put his handkerchief to my
mouth, and I don't know what he would have done, but just
then I heard a rap at the door, and somebody demanded to
come in, but the door was locked, and he could not, and so
the man that held me told him, but it did no good, for he was
a strong man, and he burst the lock off in an instant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
how he did talk to the one in the room, and he made him
pay me for all the things he had picked out, and then he told
him to pack up his trunk, and leave the city by the first boat
or railroad in the morning. And then he told him how he
had watched his man&oelig;uvres, and then he took me in his
room, and talked to me so good, so kind, and asked me all
about my mother, and where she lived, and what she did, and
why I went about peddling, and all that; and then he asked
me if I would not like to go and live with some good
family in the country? and then I told him that I should like
to live with him, for, indeed, sir, I loved him, he talked so
good to me. Then he gave a little sigh, and said, 'Ah, my
girl, I wish I had a home to take you to, but I have none; I
am a lone man in the world, but I will go and see your
mother, and see what we can do for you, as you have grown
too big for such work as this. You must quit it, or ruin is
your doom,' and a great deal more, he said."</p>

<p>"And why have you followed it till now?"</p>

<p>"Because my mother would not let me quit it&mdash;in fact, sir,
I do not see how we could live if I did quit, for I make about
three dollars a week, and that is more than my mother can
make with her needle, and work every day till midnight; and
then she is sick sometimes, and so I must do something, for
mother is very feeble and says she is almost worn out, and
that I shall soon have nobody but myself to work for. I am
sure I don't know what will become of me then; do you,
sir?"</p>

<p>I thought, but dared not give it utterance. And I almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
wept at the certainty of her sad fate, if she remained in the
city; a fate she could not escape from, without abandoning
her helpless mother, one of the poor sewing women of this
pandemonium.</p>

<p>"Now, will you buy the gloves, for I have answered all
the questions you asked?"</p>

<p>"One more. What is your mother's name?"</p>

<p>"May&mdash;Mrs. May. If you should want any shirts made,
sir, there is her name and number on that little card."</p>

<p>"Is that your mother's writing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; don't she write pretty? I can write too, but
not like that."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall call and see your mother, if I want work.
Here is the money for the gloves."</p>

<p>"I cannot make change; have you got the change, or shall
I run out and get it changed? I will if you will keep my
basket."</p>

<p>"No, no; I do not wish any change. You may keep
it all."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is just the way that good old gentleman said
last night&mdash;keep it all. Ah, me!"</p>

<p>And she gave a little start of surprise as she looked at the
individual who seemed to be standing behind my chair.</p>

<p>"Why, here he is now. I do wonder if he has heard me
talking all about him? I hope I have not said anything
wrong."</p>

<p>"No, no, nothing that you need to blush for. I am glad
you have found another friend to talk with; one who is willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to pay you for the time&mdash;time is money&mdash;that he keeps
you from your business."</p>

<p>It was my turn to start now. I had heard that voice
before. In a moment I could fix it in my memory, though
it was a good many years since I had heard it, and then it was
in the wilds of the West. I offered him my hand, and said:</p>

<p>"We have shaken hands before. Your name is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lovetree. And now I know you. I thought it was some
one whom I had seen before. I saw you in such earnest conversation
with this little pedlar girl, that I could not help
drawing nigh to hear; I must own I wished to see if she
would tell you the same story she did me. I think now she
is a girl of truth. What can we do for her? Shall we go
and see her mother?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would to-morrow. She is not at home to-night.
She has gone&mdash;at any rate she told me she would go to
see a lady, a real good lady, who is worse off than my mother,
for she is in a bad house, and she wants to get away; she
told me so to-day, and they will not let her. She is one of
the best women in the world. She is a dress-maker, and
she used to live so nice in Broome street, close by my mother,
with another good girl, and that girl got married and moved
away off out West, I don't know how many thousand miles;
and this girl got married too; and, oh dear! her husband
used to get so drunk, and go to bad places, and his wife used
to work and work; my mother used to work for her, and
she was good to my mother, and that is what makes me so
sorry for her now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"How came she in the bad house you tell of, and how did
you come to find her there?"</p>

<p>"Oh my, I cannot tell you all about it, I don't know; I
know she had an auction, and she went away in a carriage,
and I felt so sorry, and I did not know where she went; but
to-day, I saw that same carriage, and saw her with that same
woman, and I followed it home, and then I went up to the
door, and I told the girl I had come to see Mrs. Morgan;
that was no lie, for I had, if I did not know before that she
was there; and that Mrs. Morgan wanted to buy some needles;
that was a lie; but what should I say, I wanted to see her so
bad; and then the girl said, she was not there, that there
was no Mrs. Morgan in the house, and then I felt bad,
because I knew she was there, and I was afraid something
was wrong, and I began to cry, indeed, sir; don't laugh at
me, I could not help it, I would have cried my eyes out to see
her, but the girl said, she was not there, and I said, I saw
her come there in the carriage, just a minute ago; and then
another girl told the servant girl, it was Lucy, Lucy Smith,
that I wanted to see; but I knew it was not, but I thought I
would go up and see Lucy Smith, and may be she would tell
me about Mrs. Morgan; and so I went to Lucy Smith's room,
and I rapped on the door, and somebody said, come in; I
thought I should go off, for I knew the voice in a minute, and
I opened the door, and then it was not Lucy Smith, they
only called her so for sham, and so that nobody would know
her; it was Mrs. Morgan. How glad I was to see her, and
how glad she was to see me; how she did hug me and kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
me, and call me her little pet; and then she told me&mdash;but
you don't want to hear&mdash;why did you not stop me before&mdash;my
mother says I always talk too much when I get a-going;
I am sorry that I have talked so much, but, oh, how I do
wish you would go and see Mrs. Morgan, and help her to get
away from there; I will give you all the money I have made
to-day, to help you, and I am sure my mother would give it
as soon as I would, for she cried and took on so when I told
her. Oh dear! I know well enough she never would be a
bad woman, unless they made her."</p>

<p>"I do not understand this matter at all; do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I replied, perfectly. Some poor unfortunate
woman, with a miserable, drunken husband, has been driven
by necessity, probably to take up her abode in some house of
sin, where she finds her life miserable, and is anxious to
escape; I suppose that is it."</p>

<p>"Anxious to escape! Why, sir, you confuse me worse
than ever. No one is obliged to stay in such houses, are
they? If she wished to go away, she could go; it is her own
sinful choice that she is there."</p>

<p>"Friend Lovetree, how long have you lived out West?"</p>

<p>"Well, some twenty-five years, I suppose. You have a
short way of turning a corner. Was I talking anything
about the West?"</p>

<p>"No. Twenty-five years. This city has changed some in
that time, and you have got behind the times. You don't
know as much as this little girl about this matter. Ask
her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"How is it little girl&mdash;what did you tell me was your
name?"</p>

<p>"Stella, sir, Stella May."</p>

<p>"Well then Stella, what is to hinder this Mrs. Morgan
from coming away if she wishes?"</p>

<p>"Because she is in debt, sir."</p>

<p>"Debt, sir, debt! do private citizens imprison their fellows
for debt? Are women compelled to live in houses of prostitution
in this city, a city where the Bible is read and gospel
preached, against their will? Preposterous, I will not believe
it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is gospel truth, as much as the Bible
itself. The keepers of such houses sometimes inveigle innocent
young girls into their dens, board and clothe them, and
get them in debt, and in fact make them slaves, as sure as
those who are bought and sold in southern cities. They
cannot leave unless they leave naked, with the mark of their
owner branded, not upon the surface of their bodies, but
burnt into the inmost recesses of the mind.</p>

<p>"Sometimes those who go there voluntarily, repent afterwards
most bitterly, most gladly would leave, but the door is
closed against them, they are shut out of the world by the
mark upon them, and shut in by their creditor mistress, or
kept in such a state of intoxication that they have no time to
redeem themselves from their life of slavery.</p>

<p>"From this little girl's account I venture to say that this
woman is some one of the thousands of poor seamstresses,
who stitch and starve in this city, who perhaps in very despair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
after a long struggle to live with a drunken husband, has
been tempted into one of these places, and is now repenting
grievously, and would gladly get away, but has not the means
to do so; for she lacks a small sum to pay her greedy
landlady some iniquitous charge, and a few dollars and some
friend to assist her in her immediate necessities. Thus she
will live a short life of excitement, and go friendless and
unwept to an early grave."</p>

<p>"She shall not. She shall not. I have money, useless, idle,
more than I shall ever want, and I have no friends. I will
be her friend, I will rescue her, and she shall be mine."</p>

<p>Stella, the little pedler, had stood as though transfixed,
during all this time, drinking in every word, until she found
that her friend, poor Mrs. Morgan, would have some one
to care for her, some one to love her as she loved her, one
who had money, "more money than he wanted," to assist her,
and then she grew as enthusiastic as Mr. Lovetree. She
caught him by the hand, and as the tears ran down her
cheeks, tears of joy, blessed tears, that drop like honey upon
the lips, sending sweetness through every channel of sensation
in the whole system, she said, "Will you, will you give her
money to get out of that place? Will you go and see her?
Will you love her? Oh I am so happy! I must run home
and tell my mother, and that will make her happy too. Now
I am so glad I told you all about it."</p>

<p>"And you will do it," said she, looking up in his face so
earnestly, "yes, I know you will, you don't look like one of
those kind of folks who say one thing and mean another."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes he would do it, I knew that; naturally enthusiastic,
though not easily carried away by sudden flaws of side winds,
when he once said, "I will do it," it was half done.</p>

<p>"Now I will run home and tell mother, for I want her to
be as happy as me. Good night."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop a moment, you have not told us where the
poor lady is that you wish us to go and see, nor what her
name is."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I forgot that. Yes I told you, Mrs. Morgan, but
you want her whole name; well that is such a pretty name;
I love pretty names; have you a card, I will write it for you."</p>

<p>"What, can you write?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir, before we got so poor, I used to go to school.
I would like to go now, but I have no time. You ought to
see my mother write; she can write so pretty."</p>

<p>I saw what was working in the benevolent old gentleman's
face, while Stella was writing. He had heard her say, "I
would like to go to school now," and he was resolving in his
mind, "Why not? Why should I not send her there? I
have none of my own to send." It was a good resolve.</p>

<p>"There, that is it. 'Mrs. Athalia Morgan, at Mrs. Laylor's
in H&mdash;&mdash;n street.' I don't recollect the number, but
you can find it easy enough; mother says it does seem as
though the evil one always stood ready to lead folks to such
houses. But you had better inquire for Lucy Smith. They
don't know her by any other name there. Shall I go now?
Good night. I am so anxious to tell mother."</p>

<p>"Athalia!&mdash;Athalia!" said my friend, as he spelt over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
name on the card. "Athalia! oh, pshaw! that is nonsense,
yet it might be&mdash;why not? I say, my little girl, you knew
her before she was married. What was her name then?"</p>

<p>"And what is that, 'why not,' and what about that name?
The little girl is well on her way home, by this time, if she
kept on at the speed she went down stairs. Her earnestness
makes me begin to feel a good deal interested in that woman."</p>

<p>"Nothing, only a thought, a mere passing thought, and
yet I cannot shake it off. It is rather an unusual name. I
had a brother&mdash;yes, I had a brother, whether I have or not
now, I cannot tell; yet he was not exactly a brother either,
though we called the same woman mother, and the same man
father, and whether he is living now or not I cannot say, but
think not. He did very badly, drank up all his property, and
took the usual course, and I suppose he is dead, and his wife
too, and then his children are orphans, and why not this be
one of them; it is the same name. Athalia&mdash;it is not a common
name; if it had been I should not remember it, for I
never saw her but once, then a little girl not as big as this one
just here. I wish she had not run away so soon, before I
could ask her a single question. What shall I do now?"</p>

<p>"Go and ask Athalia herself."</p>

<p>"What! to-night? It is now ten o'clock, time all respectable
citizens were in bed. It is too late."</p>

<p>"No, it is never too late to begin to do good. It is just the
hour that the lives of the inmates of such houses, as we propose
to visit, begin. From this till one or two o'clock, drinking,
carousing, swearing, and all sorts of revelry and debauchery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and then&mdash;&mdash;it is well that night has curtains. Now this
house where we are to go, however, I take, from its location, to
be one of a different character, one that maintains a show of
respectability, yet is one of the most dangerous, for its victims
are drawn from among a class just as good as Stella has
described Mrs. Morgan."</p>

<p>"You think, then, that we may go there safely, at this hour
of the night?"</p>

<p>"As safely, as respects our persons, as to church. As
dangerously, as respects our morals, as the poor weak bird
fluttering within the charmed circle of the fascinating serpent."</p>

<p>"As to that I fear nothing."</p>

<p>"So has said many a one. I say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'He must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil,'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>or he will soon come to such familiarity that he will eat freely
out of the same dish. No man is proof against the fascinations
of a designing woman. But as we go doubly armed, for our
cause is just, let us go, go at once, for I see you are excited
about that name. It would be strange, if it should prove to
be your niece."</p>

<p>"Yes and stranger still, the way that we have been brought
together, and to a knowledge of her, through our mutual
sympathy for this little pedler girl, such an one as we may
see every hour in the streets, without exciting a passing
thought. What a mysterious power governs all our actions,
and how we are influenced and turned aside from the path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
we had marked out, by the most trivial circumstances. I had
seen this little girl come in here and offer her little wares a
score of times, without paying any attention to her or her
movements, except to wonder how any mother could trust
such a child, bright, good-looking, free spoken, forward&mdash;that
is, precocious&mdash;among so many fops and libertines, who
would take advantage of her some day, and by deceit and
money work her ruin. Last night I had put on my gloves
and hat, and was just walking out as she came in with her
'Please to buy this, sir,' and why I did not go out I cannot
tell, but some unaccountable influence turned me back, and I
picked up a paper and sat apparently absorbed in its contents,
while my ear was open and mind awake to every word and
movement of the libertine rascal who made a pretence of
buying liberally, to induce her to go up to his room to get the
pay. I followed, watched him to his room, heard the key
turn in the lock, heard all his conversation, his vile proposals,
and her virtuous rejection, with an energy, 'that she had
rather starve and see her mother dead;' and then I heard a
struggle and I knew the villain was using his brutal strength
upon a weak girl, and then I burst the door, and then&mdash;you
know the rest."</p>

<p>"Why did you not strike the villain dead at your feet?"</p>

<p>"That is savage nature."</p>

<p>"Why not arrest and punish him, then, for his attempt at
rape?"</p>

<p>"That is civilized nature."</p>

<p>"What then did you do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"I forgave him, and bade him repent, and ask God to forgive
him, as I did."</p>

<p>"Lovetree, give me your hand, I give you my heart; I
stand rebuked. I understand you now, that was Christian
nature. Let us go."</p>

<p>Reader, walk with us. We threaded our way along the
crowded side-walk, passing or meeting, between the Astor
House and Canal street, not less than fifty girls; some of
them not over twelve years old, many about fourteen or fifteen,
some of them superbly beautiful, naturally or artificially,
and all, such as the spirit, hovering over the poor shipwrecked
mariner upon the stormy ocean, cries wildly to, as
they sink, down, down, to death, "lost, lost, lost!"</p>

<p>"Why, why, tell me why they are permitted to roam
through the streets, plying their seductive arts? Where are
your police? Where your city Fathers?&mdash;guardians of the
morals of strangers and citizens! How can anything, male
or female, remain pure in such an atmosphere of impurity?
Where are your laws? laws of love that lift up the fallen.
Where all your high-paid, well-fed city guardians, who should
watch the city youth, to keep them from becoming impure?"</p>

<p>Echo gave the answer, and it reverberated back and forth
from granite wall to freestone, from marble front to red-burnt
bricks, from dark cellar to gas-lighted hall, from low
dens of death to high rooms of wealth and fashion, from law
makers to law breakers; echo came back with that one word,
"Impure, impure, impure."</p>

<p>How the throng go thoughtlessly onward. Do they ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
think&mdash;think what a sirocco blast from the valley of the Upas
tree, is sweeping over this city? Do mothers ever inquire,
ever think whether it is possible for their sons to escape the
contagion of such company as they keep in the great evening
promenade of this mighty Babylon? Have New York
mothers no feeling of fear for their sons? or has "the pestilence
that walketh in darkness," obtained such strength that
this is overcome? or has the plague spot grown so familiar to
their eyes that they no longer seek to wash it out? If they
have given up their sons, if they have surrendered the great
street to the almost exclusive occupancy, at night, of painted
harlots; have they also given up their daughters, surrendered
them to the wiles of the seducer? do they let them go out
without fear, even in company with their male friends, to be
jostled upon the side-walks by midnight ramblers, and seated
at the same table, at some of the great "saloons," side by
side with those who win to kill, whose trade is death, whose
life is gilded misery, though enticing as the siren's song?
Have they forgotten that we are all creatures of surrounding
circumstances, subject to like influences, and liable to the
same disease as those who breathe the same atmosphere, and
if that is impure, those who breathe it may become so?</p>

<p>Even now, while I write, the "New York Daily Tribune,"
gives this "Item" to its readers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mysterious Disappearance.</span>&mdash;On Sunday evening last, between
six and seven o'clock, Miss G. C&mdash;&mdash; left her father in Spring street,
near Broadway, to go to her brother-in-law's (Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;), No. &mdash; Spring
street, since which time nothing has been heard of her, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>is feared that she has been dealt foully with. She is seventeen years
of age, good-looking and rather tall; dark complexion, and dark eyes;
lisps somewhat when in conversation. She was dressed in plaid, light
and dark stripe; Talma cape; straw bonnet, trimmed with white outside,
and green and white inside. Her disappearance has caused the deepest
affliction to her family, and any information that can be given will be
gratefully received by her aged parent, No.&mdash;Spring street."</p></blockquote>

<p>"It is feared that she has been foully dealt with." Yes,
and it ought to be feared that "good-looking, rather tall"
young girls, are foully dealt with in the streets of this city,
every night in the week. It is feared she is not the first girl
of seventeen, whose "mysterious disappearance has caused
the deepest affliction to her family."</p>

<p>"Any information will be gratefully received." Yes, any
information will be gratefully received by the author of this
book, which he can use effectually to awaken aged parents to
the fact, that each one of these girls who wander the streets
at midnight, or who fill up the dens of infamy that line
whole blocks of some of the best streets in this city, is somebody's
child; some "mysterious disappearance," that has
caused deep affliction, and will cause more, for she is now
influencing others to disappear from the path of rectitude, in
the same way that she did.</p>

<p>Perhaps, yea, it is probable, more than probable, that Miss
G. C&mdash;&mdash; has been inveigled into one of these dens where
worse than cannibals live, for they only eat the body, while
these destroy the soul.</p>

<p>How long would a house be permitted to stand, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
human flesh was served up as a banquet for those who
delighted to feast upon such dainty food? A house where
young girls were driven in by force or fascination, to be
cooked and eaten by young epicures and gouty gormandizers.
How the city's indignation would boil over, and how the
storm of wrath would beat upon that house, until there would
not be one stone left upon another.</p>

<p>Yet how calmly that same public sleeps on by the side of
a thousand worse houses, where victims are worse than
cooked and eaten every day&mdash;they are roasted alive.</p>

<p>How coldly parents will read that "mysterious disappearance;"
they will never think that girl has been destroyed by
cannibals, far worse are here&mdash;they belong to savage life.</p>

<p>How carelessly, how thoughtlessly mothers will read this
page that tells how their daughters may be influenced to ruin
themselves, by such unfortunate associations as they must
meet with in their walks through the city, while our municipal
government permits the streets to be monopolized by the
impure, because it is itself just what the echo answered.</p>

<p>How I would rejoice if I could make the truth manifest, as
regards this matter, that, "to the pure all things are pure."</p>

<p>Now, let us walk on.</p>

<p>You need not stop to drop anything into the hand of that
woman with a child on her lap. True, she looks like a pitiable
object, with her opium-drugged infant wrapped in that
old blue cloak, but she is not. She is a professional beggar.
I have known her these three years. That child is not hers.
It is hired for the purpose. It draws a share of the benefit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
as it does the sympathy of those who are attracted by that
well-put-on, appealing look. That child is kept by a woman
who keeps three others "to let." They never grow too big.
Laudanum is not the food that infants grow upon. They will
die young, and others will be begged, borrowed, or stolen, for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>There, the sixpence you have given that little child, will go
into the till of that "family grocery," before we are a block
farther on our way. I know her.</p>

<p>It is hardly charity to give to that man; I know him too,
and where he lives.</p>

<p>"But, he is blind."</p>

<p>I know it, and that is his fortune. With it he supports
himself and family of great idle girls and boys, better than
many others live who labor. He is a stout, rugged, hearty
man, capable of doing much useful labor, if he had any one
to direct him.</p>

<p>"Well, here, what of this?"</p>

<p>Yes, you may give there; no, give me the quarter, see
what I will do with it. I will buy two smiles.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Joseph, how do you do this evening?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, sir, thank you. How are you this
evening?"</p>

<p>"Very well. How is trade with you, Joseph? Do these gay
people buy your bouquets?"</p>

<p>"Well, some do, sir, but these big boys and stout men can
run about and forestall a poor black man who has got no legs."</p>

<p>"Joseph, has that sewing woman been down this evening;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the one who always stops to give you a kind word and look,
and smell of your flowers?"</p>

<p>"What, the one that looks so pale, the one who makes
shirt collars; the one you gave the bouquet to, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I want you to give her another, here is the
money."</p>

<p>"I wish I had known it a few minutes ago, for her daughter
went by; she stopped a moment just to admire this one,
and said, how she did wish she could afford to buy it for her
mother; and then she said, it did not matter, she had such
good news to tell her, and she picked up her basket, and
away she ran."</p>

<p>There was a queer idea came into my mind, when he said
basket, just as though there could be but one girl out to-night
with a basket. I was about to drive away the idea as a foolish
one, when something whispered me, "Ask him." So I
did.</p>

<p>"A girl with a basket? Who is that girl with a basket;
do you know her name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. We call her, the little pedler. She is a nice
girl. Her mother's name is May."</p>

<p>The queer idea was a true one after all. And so this
woman, whom I had often seen speaking pleasant words to
this poor legless Negro man, who sits night after night, upon
the Broadway side-walk, selling bouquets, is Mrs. May, the
little pedler's mother.</p>

<p>"Do you know where she lives?&mdash;could you get anybody
to carry this to her to-night?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, here is Tom Top, he will go in a minute; he
will do anything for me, or for a lady; he is ragged and dirty,
but he is a good boy; it is a pity he had not somebody to be
good to him. Tom, will you go to Mrs. May's for me?
Stella, the little pedler's mother, you know where she lives?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, shall I carry that? Is that for Stella?"</p>

<p>"No, that is for her mother."</p>

<p>"And this," said Mr. Lovetree, picking up another beauty,
"this is for Stella. Stop, Tom. Here is a shilling for you.
Don't tell who sent you. Now let us go on. You know this
poor black fellow, then, do you? What is his name!"</p>

<p>"Joseph Butler. He was a sailor. He was shipwrecked,
and lost his legs by freezing, fourteen years ago. He has
been to sea five years since, as cook, hobbling around on
the stumps. Now, he supports his family by selling bouquets.
Did you ever see a finer face? Always cheerful, intelligent,
and polite; it is a pleasure to buy flowers of him. It is a
wonder that ladies and gentlemen do not all feel it a duty
and pleasure both, to buy all their bouquets of this poor cripple."</p>

<p>"It is because they never think. If they did, they certainly
would."</p>

<p>"Then, I must ask them to think. I must try and
awaken the sympathies of the benevolent to look at this poor
unfortunate black man as they pass, and see if they do not
think him a fit subject for honest sympathy. He is not a
beggar. He gives a fair equivalent for your money. At
least, give him a kind word, or pleasant look, and he will
return you the same."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>How we do linger in our walk. So will you, reader, if you
come to New York, and undertake to see all the curiosities
of Broadway, in one night.</p>

<p>At length, we reached Mrs. Laylor's. It is a handsome
house, in a quiet street. My friend hesitated about entering.
He thought I must be mistaken. It did not look like
what he had conceived of such houses. Then he was afraid
they would suspect us, and would not let us in.</p>

<p>"For the fact is, we do not look much like the class of
men who visit such places," said he.</p>

<p>"That shows how little you know of life in New York.
Let me manage this matter, and I assure you, they will think
us two old rakes, rich ones, too, out of whom they may make
a harvest."</p>

<p>So we went up the broad, high steps, and rang the bell
with a jerk, that said, as near as bells can speak, that is
somebody that has been here before. The lady, as is the
usual practice, came herself to the door, unlocked it, and
opened it a little way, where it is held by a chain, so that she
could reconnoitre, and if the company did not suit, or if a
stranger applied, she would refuse him, particularly, if she
had plenty of company, unless he could give very good
references.</p>

<p>I thought of that, and so I said, with the same confidence
that I had put into my pull of the bell, "Good evening, Mrs.
Laylor, how do you do this evening? You were unwell the
other evening when I was here. This is Mr. Treewell, from
the South." That was an "open sesame," that undid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
chain directly, and we walked in as old acquaintances. True,
she could not exactly locate us, but our easy assurance
carried us through.</p>

<p>"Walk into the parlor, gentlemen, there is nobody there,
we are quite alone this evening. Or, will you go in the back
room; the young ladies and I were having a little game of
whist together, to drive off the dullness."</p>

<p>Yes, to drive off the dullness, thought I; to get rid of the
horror of thinking. That is the greatest curse that this class
of women have to endure. They cannot bear to think.
They must have something "to drive off the dullness." If
they have no company, they must play cards, or something
else to keep away thought. If they have company, wine is
the panacea. They cannot afford to buy it themselves, but
they often persuade gentlemen to do so, pretending to be very
thirsty, when they have just been drinking, because that is a
part of the contract upon which they are kept by the mistress
of the house. If a girl had any conscientious scruples
about coaxing a gentleman to buy, or about drinking, or
wasting all the wine that all of them would buy, she would
be trained into the work, or turned out of doors. So that it
is a very rare thing for one of them to go to bed sober. In
the morning, or rather towards night, when they wake up,
they are almost unable to dress themselves for the next scene
in the round of dissipation, until they have sent out and got
a little cheap rum, "to bring them up."</p>

<p>Those who have studied the life of these poor, wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
women as carefully as I have, will not wonder at the shortness
of it.</p>

<p>Of course we accepted the very polite invitation to go in
where the young ladies were. We had an object in doing
so. Neither of us knew Mrs. Morgan, and if we should
inquire for her, if it suited the convenience of madame she
would palm off any other one that she thought she could make
pass. I adopted my plan of operations very quickly. I thought
if they had had no company yet to-night, they had had no
wine, and consequently would not be in the best of moods
to be communicative. As soon as we were introduced, I
ordered a bottle of wine and thought I would find out if
either of the three girls present answered to the name of Lucy,
and if she did, I intended to whisper one word in her ear, and
that word should be "Athalia," and watch what emotion it
produced.</p>

<p>It would be entirely impossible for a stranger to form an
idea what an emotion the very name of wine caused among
them. They were fairly longing for it. We were in the
good graces of all the household at once. I pleaded headache
not to drink. Lovetree took his glass with them. I
fixed upon one that I thought perhaps might be Athalia, but
soon found that she was called Nannette.</p>

<p>Another was Belle, and the third was Adelaide. The latter
was one of the most perfectly beautiful girls in face and form
I ever saw, and she had really pretty red hair. I have often
met or passed her since that in the street and never without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
admiring her beauty and thinking of her mother, and how
she must mourn "a girl lost."</p>

<p>I was now satisfied that Athalia was not in the room, and
I said carelessly. "Where is that other girl I saw here, with
brown hair and blue eyes, not very tall?"</p>

<p>"What was her name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, confound names, I never can think of names."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know who he means," said Adelaide, "it is Lucy,
Lucy Smith."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is it. It is Lucy at any rate."</p>

<p>"She is in her room. She has got the dumps&mdash;the blues&mdash;I
should not wonder if she was all melted by this time,
she has been crying these three days."</p>

<p>"Crying, why what has she to cry about? I should not
think anybody need to cry in this house, you never cry, do
you?"</p>

<p>The very question almost brought a tear, but she drove it
back.</p>

<p>"Well, Lucy must come down and have some wine. Get
her down, and we will have another bottle."</p>

<p>"She won't come. We are all tired of trying. She has
got the pouts, because Mrs. Laylor took her trunk away from
her to keep for her board. She don't make any thing. All
she ever did make was out of Frank Barkley, and that she
gave to redeem her watch and a good-for-nothing old Bible I
don't see what she wants of that."</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to have her down&mdash;I have no opinion
of having any girl in the dumps. Where is her room?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Third floor back room. That is right, go and bring her
out whether or no. She has hardly been out for a week till
to-day Mrs. Laylor took her out riding with her, to try to put
a little life in her, for fear she would die on her hands, and
she would have to bury her for charity."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I will bring her down, see if I don't. Come,
Treewell, if she will not come without we will bring her."</p>

<p>So away we went upstairs, now satisfied that we were on
the right trail, and that we had completely lulled all suspicion
that we wanted anything of Lucy Smith, except to compel
the poor heart-sick woman to join in a Bacchanalian revel, at
which her soul revolted. Up, up we went, passed three
"private rooms," in which we will not seek to look, for they
are occupied by those who come veiled and in the dark.
Here is the room we want. We knocked but received no
welcome "come in."</p>

<p>How quick she would open the door if she knew who was
waiting for admission. Tired of knocking, we enter unbidden,
and find the room empty. The prisoner has escaped.</p>

<p>The truth flashed upon my mind in a moment. She has
gone off with Mrs. May. Mr. Lovetree thought not, for Stella
said they would not let her go out except some one in the
house went with her to watch her.</p>

<p>"No matter. I am almost sure that woman has got her
away. These women are great at contrivance. Very likely
she came prepared for it, as Stella told her of course, all that
Mrs. Morgan had told her."</p>

<p>We made a light and the first thing that Lovetree saw was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the Bible, and Athalia's name&mdash;her age and birth-place and
the age and names of her father and mother and grandfather
and grandmother, a complete family record. I thought the
man would go crazy. It would have made him nearly crazy
if he had found her an inmate here, as much lost to shame
as those we had just been carousing with, and now to find
that she was not here put him into a perfect agony. He
thought he could not live till morning without seeing her.
At first we thought of going directly to Mrs. May's but then
we recollected we did not know where she lived and could
not find out, for I had lost her card that Stella gave me.</p>

<p>Finally we concluded to go down and talk a minute in the
same kind of sang froid manner, to keep up our assumed
characters and then go home and await coming events.</p>

<p>We were rallied as we entered the room with a jeering
laugh at not being able to bring one woman between us both.</p>

<p>Then I pretended to get angry at being sent upon a fool's
errand, to a room where nobody was at home. At that Mrs.
Laylor started.</p>

<p>"Was she not in the room?"</p>

<p>"No, nor has not been lately. You are playing tricks
with the wrong persons, trying to fool us."</p>

<p>"Indeed, gentlemen, upon my honor it is no trick."</p>

<p>She rang the servants' bell violently. "Martha, do you
know where Lucy Smith is? She is not in her room.
Have you let her out to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. I have not let anybody out but that
sewing woman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is Kate? Send Kate up. Kate have you let anybody
out to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. I let that sewing woman out."</p>

<p>"You let her out! Martha says she let her out."</p>

<p>"So I did."</p>

<p>"And so did I."</p>

<p>"Both of you."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Well, I did."</p>

<p>"You have let out the &mdash;&mdash;. Get out of the room, you
stupid Irish &mdash;&mdash;s. You have let out the sewing woman,
sure enough. I have lost my bet which I made with
Frank, of a hundred dollars that I would keep her here
till she would not want to go away."</p>

<p>And there was such, a string of oaths as I never heard before,
and hope I never shall hear again, particularly from
female profane lips. None but a drunken slave driver, ever
poured out such a stream of awful language, full of oaths, anger
and billingsgate expressions, at the escape of one of his victims,
as she did at the escape of a woman whom she had
determined to debase to her own level, until she had brought
her to that condition that she would feel degraded in the eyes
of the world, would know that all her own sex had closed and
barred the door against her, so that she could never return to
the paths of virtue, and she would be to her mistress a "profitable
investment," for she would be attractive, by her beauty
and manners, and "draw custom to the house." But she had
escaped&mdash;gone off too in a temper of mind which might send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
retribution back upon the head of one who under the guise of
friendship had first robbed, then by pretended debt, enslaved
her mind, coaxed and almost driven her into intoxication,
and then prostituted her most shamefully. It would be idle
to pretend that Athalia had escaped without sin. She had
not. She had sinned deeply. She said afterwards while
claiming some extenuation, though by no means trying to
justify her fall, that her mind was so wrought upon by her
disappointments of life, by her lone and friendless condition,
by the accumulation of debt, by the terrible treachery of those
she had entrusted herself with as such disinterested friends,
by her anxiety to obtain her valued keepsakes and get money
enough to redeem them, and then escape from the pandemonium
she found that she had unwittingly entered, that she had
determined to drown her thoughts in wine, and then she accepted
the oft-repeated proposals of Frank Barkley to redeem her
watch, which he honorably did, but which another <i>friend</i>,
one of Mrs. Laylor's friends, whom she forced her to accept,
and which cost her the friendship of Frank, robbed her of, and
carried off so that she never saw it again; whether he kept
it or gave it to Mrs. Laylor, she never knew.</p>

<p>Often she intended to fly, but it seemed to her that she
could not get away; she was kept in one constant whirl of
excitement so that she could not reason with herself long
enough to determine what to do. What deterred her most,
was that she had nowhere to go to, no friend to call upon
for counsel or assistance, and thus she went on from day to
day, adopting one plan in the morning to discard it at night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank was very kind to her in a certain measure. He liked
her, but it was a very selfish liking. He did not like to hear her
talk about leaving. He liked her there, and he was almost
as much her jailer as Mrs. Laylor. He took her out to all
manner of dissipation, theatres, saloons, late suppers, balls and
frolics, in which strong drink&mdash;not Athalia Morgan&mdash;acted as
wild a part as the wildest. But he offered her no means of
escape. She began to have a sort of fondness for Frank.
What woman can avoid liking one who is devoted to her?
But this devotion to one was not what Mrs. Laylor wished.
It was not what brought the most money to her iron chest.
She would like to negotiate the charms of Athalia to some
rich libertine every day, whenever she could meet with one
fool enough to pay her well for her influence with the "young
widow."</p>

<p>Among the most determined of her suitors, was a young
Frenchman, who used every art which he knew well how to
use with words and money, to win Athalia's favor. As a last resort,
he pledged a splendid diamond ring to Mrs. Laylor, if
she would accomplish what he could not.</p>

<p>When all other arts fail to work ruin and misery in a
woman's mind, there is one left, one which concentrates all the
power of all the lies of the father of deception. It is jealousy.</p>

<p>There is a little story in "Othello," about the arts of a villain,
to produce mischief by that power. It is nothing compared
with the villainy and lies invented to produce jealousy
between Frank and Athalia, so as to let in the Frenchman,
and win that ring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Villainy is too often successful in this life. It was in this
case. Jealousy, a feeling of revenge, drives more women to
infidelity towards those they love, than all other causes.</p>

<p>It did its perfect work with Athalia, and then the fiend
who had accomplished the work, laughed at her, and told her
how she had been fooled, thinking it would have the usual
effect, to make her careless of what she did in future. It had
an entirely different effect upon Athalia. It was this that
produced the state of mind that Adelaide called the dumps,
the blues, and the tears that Stella saw her shed. Stella
had told her mother much that Athalia told her, much that
the child did not understand, but the mother did, for she
knew how girls were inveigled into those houses, and kept
there as prisoners.</p>

<p>I have lately witnessed a scene, highly illustrative of this
fact. It is one of the "Life Scenes of New York."</p>

<p>Coming up one of the streets west of Broadway, about one
o'clock at night, I saw a fellow hovering near a house, whom
I recognized as a Negro wood-sawyer that I had seen the day
before, engaged at the same house, putting wood down the
cellar grate. I knew him or thought I did, as a poor but
honest man, and I felt pained with a fear that I had been
deceived, that he had left the grate unfastened, and now was
about to steal something from the cellar. I passed on around
the next corner, out of sight, and then turned back and
crossed over, where I could have a full view of his operations.
There were no lamps burning, because there should, or might
have been moonlight, if it had been clear; as it was, it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
fitting time for the burglar's trade. Directly, the fellow
approached the grate, opened it carefully, and drew up a trunk.
My heart beat with excitement, fear, and sorrow. I was just
on the point of calling, "Watch," I must own with a view
of letting the fellow escape, and saving the trunk, when I saw
a bonnet, then a shawl, and then a full suit of woman's
clothes follow the trunk up from that dark recess. My mind
was somewhat relieved; my honest wood-sawyer might be
honest still, though he was probably assisting a dishonest
woman; else why did she leave that house, to all appearance,
an honest house, for all that I had ever seen in passing it a
hundred times, in such a clandestine manner. The Negro
walked on with the trunk on his shoulder, and the woman
followed. It was a scene of such frequent occurrence, that it
would excite no suspicion or question from a policeman. He
would think it was a passenger by the train, from Boston, or
Albany, or the Erie railroad, all of which make midnight
arrivals.</p>

<p>On they went, block after block, and I followed, till I
thought the chase likely to prove a long one, and then I
stepped up to the woman, and laying my hand upon her
shoulder, said, "Stop!" She uttered a little cry of alarm,
and said, "Oh, don't take me up, please don't."</p>

<p>The Negro stopped, looked round, and set down the trunk
hastily, evidently supposing that a star had nabbed her, and
that the better part of a fight consists in running away.
There was a light here, for the lamp-lighters were just going
their late rounds. He gave one glance back before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
started, to be sure he had good cause to run, and instantly
burst into a most merry fit of laughter, very unlike what
might be supposed that of a caught burglar.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! ki, missee, you don't know dat gemman?
You nebber seed dat gemman 'fore? You tink him a star?
Look at um. You tink he look so he hurt you? He
wouldn't hurt a child, much more a woman. I know dat
gemman. Ki, I mighty glad to see him. 'Spose tell him all
about um? Spec he say a body has a right to steal he own
trunk, and run away from such a house as dat."</p>

<p>"Such a house as that, Peter; is that not a good house?"</p>

<p>"Well, spec him house good enough, but spec he folks dat
lib dare, not 'zactly straight up and down like dog hind
leg."</p>

<p>"Why, Peter, what do you mean? Is not that Mr.
Ingram, whose name I see on the door, and whom I know as
apparently a gentleman of wealth and leisure, for I have
often seen him associating with gentlemen about the hotels;
is he not the gentleman of the house?"</p>

<p>"Gentlum! Lord, sir, he is dat woman's man, her pimp,
she gives him all dem fine clothes and gold rings, and he gets
fellows to come an see her gals."</p>

<p>"Mercy on me! The outside of the platter is made clean,
while the inside is full of dead men's bones."</p>

<p>"Dat's just what Agnes says; she says, she find dead men's
bones in the ashes, and buttons, and bits of burnt woman's
clothes in a pile in the cellar, and she seed woman's ghost
dare, and she won't stay in dat house no how can fix um, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
dat's what it mean 'bout I got dis trunk; did you see how I
get him, massa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, and I want to know something about why
you 'get him' at this time of night out of that cellar. The
ghost story won't do; if she was afraid of ghosts she would
not go down into that cellar at night any more than she
would go down to her grave. It won't do."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, the ghost goes upstairs every night, to stay in the
room where she was seduced. None of the girls in the house
will stay in that room. They gave it to me when first I went
there. I did not know it was haunted then, but I found out
afterwards that it was, for she told me so, and how she was shut
up in the coal cellar, and starved, and suffocated to death, and
then cut up, and part of her body burned, and part buried
in lime and ashes, and how, if I would look in one corner
of the cellar, I would find some of her bones, and I did; and
then I determined to run away, and that is why I am hero."</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"I am going home with Peter, I have got nowhere else to
go, and then I shall try to get a place."</p>

<p>"A place! Why, Peter, is not this one of the girls of that
house?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, not 'zactly; but 'spose you go wid us in my
house, he close by here now, and she tell you all about herself.
I spec she not a bad gal, sir."</p>

<p>"Go ahead then;" and he shouldered his load, and went a
few steps farther, and then turned into a dark alley, where I
should have hesitated about following the burglars, but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
followed the honest, good-hearted wood-sawyer, and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;
with delightful pleasure, up the long, dark alley into the
centre of the block, and there was a tenant house, inhabited
by the better class of blacks. Compared with some of those
full of foreigners, it was a little paradise. Up, up to the
sixth story, that is where the poor live; here is where the
poor legless Negro flower-seller lives, with his nice little
family; a door opened as we approached, and a light shined
out, and a voice said:</p>

<p>"Is dat you, Peter? Has you got her, Peter? Thank
God for that!"</p>

<p>It was Peter's wife, rejoicing at the rescue of a woman
from perdition. One of a poor, down-trodden race, a member
of a Christian church, yet considered unworthy to sit by
the side of white skinned (thin skinned) Christians, doing a
most Christian act, such an one as many of her sisters in the
church would consider beneath their dignity to do.</p>

<p>We entered Peter's home. It was but one small room,
scantily, yet neatly furnished. There was a little stove, and
all necessary cooking utensils, and plenty of dishes, a table, a
bureau, a carpet on the floor, a stand in one corner covered
with a clean white cloth, and on this a large Bible, covered
with green baize, lying open, with Phebe's spectacles on the
page, indicating her employment while waiting and watching
for Peter to return, as she expected, with company&mdash;one more
than she expected. There was a bedstead in one corner, from
which a portion of the bed had been removed and made into
a nice pallet upon the floor, in readiness for an expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
lodger. Agnes met a warm welcome from Phebe. We
shall see Phebe again, out on another errand of mercy. In
some of these ever shifting scenes, we may have another
glimpse of Agnes. Peter explained to Phebe, how I
happened to be in company, and then we all sat down to hear
Agnes's story. I shall not tell it now. But I will tell here
another little story, which will give a clue to what she said
about the haunted house.</p>

<p>It is a story about "a girl lost."</p>

<p>The "Tribune" one day published an appeal to the kind-hearted
of the city, to give a distracted family some information
of "a girl lost."</p>

<p>She was "a good-looking, rather tall girl, seventeen years
of age, dark complexion and dark hair. She was well-dressed,
and started to go from her father's house in Spring
street, near Broadway, to her brother's in the same street.</p>

<p>"And she was lost!"</p>

<p>Some stranger who reads that simple announcement, one
who has spent a night at one of the three great hotels on the
corners of Spring street and Broadway, may wonder that a
girl should be lost in such a respectable neighborhood. He
does not know that the guests of one of those great hotels
look down from one side upon one of the worst gambling
hells and police-permitted gambling lottery offices in the
city, and on the other side upon still worse premises;
houses which the vocabulary of infamous language has no
words black enough to describe; houses which are ever open
for innocent young girls to enter&mdash;from which innocent young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>girls never return. They are "lost." This is not the first
girl lost in New York. These are not the first parents who
have been deeply afflicted; who have appealed in vain
through the press for any information of "a girl lost."</p>

<p>I have a little incident to relate of a girl lost. A few years
ago No. 000 Church street, was accounted the "luckiest house
in the street." There are a great many unlucky ones in that
street now, and that particular one is esteemed the most unlucky
of all of them. It should be so. It was in that house about three
years ago, that a girl was lost. For the sake of her parents,
brothers and sisters, and large family of relatives, I will not give
her true name. You may call it Julia Montgomery. She was
just such a girl as the one described in the "Mysterious Disappearance!"
She was tall and handsome, just seventeen,
with dark hair and eyes, and well dressed. She lived in one of
the river towns, and came down upon one of the barges that
float down such a multitude of things produced by farmers,
in company with her father and mother, who brought some
of their own produce to market. On the same boat were
two young men who had been up the river, they said, on a
sporting excursion. This was true. But they might have
added, "What is sport to us is death to you." They were
gamblers. On the passage they made the acquaintance of
Julia, and by their bland manners completely won the confidence
of the old folks. When they arrived, they were very
anxious that Julia should go home with them and see their
sisters. They were not so anxious that her mother should go,
but they insisted very hard that she should, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
knew she would not; she had her butter and eggs and
chickens to sell, and lots of shopping to do, so Julia went
alone. She came back to the boat towards night to tell her
mother what nice girls the Miss Camptowns were, and that
they wanted she should go with them to the theatre, and then
as it would be late, stay all night. The mother consented,
as Mr. Camptown was such a fine young man. After the
play they had an oyster supper and wine, and Julia became
very much elated. Then they went home, to Mr. Camptown's
home, which was no other than that notorious Church street
den, and the "sisters" the most notorious sinners in it. Of
course more wine was drank, and Julia became oblivious of
what transpired. She waked to consciousness next morning
to find herself&mdash;"a girl lost." Almost delirious, she flew
from the wicked scoundrel at her side to the street door, to
find it barred against her. In vain she begged and prayed,
and cried to be let out. The soul incarcerated in the infernal
regions might as well pray for egress. She finds in both
cases only scoffing at the victim's agony. Then she grew
wildly furious, and then they tied her hands and feet and
carried her down into the coal cellar, "to let her get over her
fit, and keep her out of sight till the old woman was out of
the way." For three days, Camptown watched her father
and mother, and then they gave up and went home with
heavy hearts, for "a girl was lost." Yes, she was "lost."
Then Camptown went back to enjoy his "country beauty."
She was lost to him also. In some of the pullings down and
diggings up in that street, all that remains to earth will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
another "Item" in a daily paper. It will be headed "Human
bones found."</p>

<p>The inmates of that house soon left. It was no longer a
lucky house. The ghost of that murdered girl walked
through every room. One in particular, it never allowed any
one to occupy. It is said that that ghost still haunts that
house. It is still an unlucky house. The old harridan who
kept it&mdash;well known in that street when that girl was lost&mdash;went
off to New Orleans, lost all her property, and then
was lost herself. Camptown still lives. I saw him a few
days ago, in the very street where that girl was lost, noticed
in the "Tribune." Has he any connection with her loss?
Reader, there is a girl lost. Ask where and why? Rum
and gambling can answer.</p>

<p>Now, let us leave Agnes in the hands of the wood-sawyer
and his wife, those good-hearted, kind Christians, that
despised, because black-skinned, brother and sister, more
worthy than many of the despisers, and return to Mrs. May,
and see how she effected the rescue of another prisoner.</p>

<p>What Stella told her mother was sufficient to give her the
most intense anxiety about Athalia. She was so well acquainted
with the ways of the wicked in this city, that she
felt satisfied that her friend wanted good counsel, and perhaps
assistance, and she determined to give it to one who had often
given such to her. As soon as it was sufficiently dark, she
slipped on a shawl and hood, and went into a neighbor's and
borrowed another just like her own.</p>

<p>"What in the world do you want of it?" said the woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"No matter, it shall come safe back to you, in the course
of the evening."</p>

<p>So it did, and with it came Athalia, who, by that double,
had eluded her jailers.</p>

<p>Lovetree went to his hotel in a state of mind not to be envied.
He had found the strongest evidence that his niece
had been in a house which pollutes all who breathe its atmosphere,
and he had heard vile women speak of her as one of
themselves, and he knew not how far she was like them. He
had witnessed an exposition of character that night, such as
he never had before conceived possible. He first saw Mrs.
Laylor, a specimen of a high-bred lady,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bland as the dewy morn<br></span>
<span class="i0">That opes the buds to flowers.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then he saw her furious as the winds,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Boreas rudely driven,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wild as the storm, when Jove hurls down<br></span>
<span class="i0">His thunderbolts from Heaven.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>He trembled with fear that she would pursue Athalia, and
drag her back, and perhaps hide her where he could never
find her. Undoubtedly she would have exercised her vindictiveness
upon Athalia in some way, if she had known where
she was. Lovetree had heard Mrs. Laylor swear that Athalia
had robbed her, and that she would have her punished,
and although he did not believe a word of such a charge, he
believed that vile woman wicked enough to swear away an
innocent girl's life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>He was quite mistaken. She was furious at her disappointment
and loss of gain, for gold she worshipped, but after all
she would not have done a thing to put the life or liberty of
Athalia in danger of the law. The restraint she had put upon
her, was one of policy, all in the way of her business. Lying
and cheating were a part of her trade; it is of some others.
She had been outwitted by one whom she thought too tame
to resent an injury, or protect herself. Lovetree did not know
that like a furious wind it would soon blow out, or that a portion
of her apparent anger was put on for effect, for one of the
other girls was held by a slender thread, and it was an
object to deter her from taking the same step that Athalia
had.</p>

<p>It is a great object&mdash;great as it is with the merchant to get
new goods&mdash;with all this class of houses to get new girls;
those fresh from the country are objects of great importance;
hence the effort to keep them until their conscience is obliterated
from hearts made for virtuous actions, and then they stay
willingly&mdash;often, have to beg for the privilege of staying, for
"old goods" in this branch of trade are a greater drug in the
market of seduction, than old dry goods upon the merchant's
shelves. They are more like old meat upon the butcher's stall;
nobody wants to buy, though all may admire its fatness, and
remark how good it had been, but when they examine closely,
an odor cometh up to the nostrils, which giveth offence to the
stomach.</p>

<p>Men treat all these poor girls as children treat toys. The
fresh and beautiful are admired, then barely tolerated, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
kicked aside to make room for a fresh set. Hence all the arts
that cunning vile women know of are used to obtain new toys
for their customers.</p>

<p>Lovetree slept but little that night. How he did walk
up and down the corridors of the Astor house the next
morning, watching every one that entered, hoping it might be
the little pedler girl. She was at home and asleep. She got
home before her mother, and went to bed, so that she knew
nothing of the coming of Mrs. Morgan. All slept late, and
Stella's mother saw her daughter sleeping so sweetly that she
could not bear to wake her for her daily task until breakfast
was ready. How delighted she was to see Mrs. Morgan!
"Oh, mother, mother, let me go and tell that gentleman; I
will bring him right here. He will be so glad to see Mrs.
Morgan."</p>

<p>"So glad to see me, Stella, who is it that knows me?"</p>

<p>"He don't know you at all. But when I told him about
you, he and that other gentleman said that they would go
right off to Mrs. Laylor's, and get you away."</p>

<p>"Why, Stella, my daughter, who are you talking about?
We do not understand a word you are saying."</p>

<p>"Don't you, no, you do not; I had forgotten that I had not
told you about those two nice gentlemen that I met at the
Astor house last night. Oh, mother, where did you get those
bouquets? As I live there is the very one that I looked at and
talked about with Joseph Butler, last night. Did you buy
them, mother?"</p>

<p>"No, Tom Top brought them here just as we got home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
said that an old gray-headed gentleman bought them of Joseph,
and gave him a shilling to bring them here, one for me,
and one for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my, that must be him, who else could it be? And
then, only think of it, his name is just like Mrs. Morgan's before she
was married."</p>

<p>"What, Lovetree? Is his name Lovetree? How remarkable
it would be if he should turn out to be my uncle from the
West."</p>

<p>"So it would. Now I think of it, he does look like you.
No, no, I cannot eat now, I must run and tell him, that you
are here, it will make him so happy."</p>

<p>So it did. There was another happy person that day; ah,
two or three of them, for Mrs. May and Stella were almost as
happy as Athalia; when he came they saw how quickly she
recognized him, and how overjoyed he was to see her, and
how he hugged her and kissed her, and then he took Stella
in his arms and kissed her, and told her that she should
never go out peddling again; that he would set her mother up
in a little shop, and Stella should be her clerk, for he felt that
he owed all that he now enjoyed to her, and he owed her
mother a great debt for her kind intention and goodness of
heart, in getting Athalia away from that house; and then he
told them all about his visit to Mrs. Laylor's, and Mrs. May
told all about how she worked her plan to get Athalia away;
how she dressed her up and sent her down first, and then she
watched until she saw the other girl in the hall, and then
went down herself. Then Stella said, she must run and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Joseph, she wanted Joseph to tell that other gentleman; and
so she did, and Joseph told "the other gentleman," when he
came by and stopped to give the poor crippled black man a
kind word, which always lighted up a pleasant smile upon
his fine face; and in the evening the two gentlemen, and the
two ladies, and the dear little girl, all sat down in Mrs. May's
little parlor, to such a supper, as, perhaps, never had been set
in that room before. This was one of Mr. Lovetree's whims.
It was a thanksgiving supper, he said, for the prodigal
returned, and he wanted to eat it there, all by themselves;
and so he went out and ordered the best of everything that
could be provided sent there, and then as happy a party sat
down as ever enjoyed a supper in New York. Athalia and
her uncle had talked all day, and she had told him all the
secrets of her life, and he had forgiven her everything, and
told her that he would love her as long as she would love
him. Then he asked Stella to go out and get him some
writing materials, and then her eyes fairly danced with joy
as she ran and got her own little portfolio, one that she had
made herself out of some colored paper, and asked him if he
would use her pen and paper. He did so, and then wrapped
up the little home-made article in a newspaper, and carried it
away with him, without saying a word. Stella thought it
very queer that he should do so, and she almost dropped a
tear at the thought of losing it, for it had cost her a good
many hours of busy work to make it. After awhile a boy
brought it back, wrapped in the same paper, but as it had
her name on the outside, she thought she would open it, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
see what he had put in it; "some paper, I dare say, in place
of that which he had used." That was not what she found;
she found in place of her old one, the most beautiful portfolio
that could be found in New York, filled with all sorts of stationery
that could be desired.</p>

<p>After supper was over, of course Stella had to get her portfolio,
and show it, and talk about it; and then Mr. Lovetree
talked about what he had written with Stella's pen&mdash;it was
his will.</p>

<p>"I have made," said he, "Athalia my heir. I adopt her as
my daughter, and shall always treat her as my child. I hope
she will always feel towards me as she would if I were her
father in fact. She is an orphan, and she is&mdash;&mdash;a widow."</p>

<p>"A widow&mdash;a widow?"</p>

<p>"Is Walter dead?"</p>

<p>"Is that so, uncle&mdash;father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is so. When I went to the attorney to see if I
had got my will all right, and when he came to the name of
Athalia Morgan, he said, 'Oh, that is Walter Morgan's
widow.' Then, I said, widow, widow, just as you all did a
minute since. And he told me, that was the fact; and a
good thing it was that he was dead, for he got to be a
terrible sot. And now, Athalia is my heir, and my executor.
When I am dead she will do what she pleases with what I
leave, and get married again if she likes; she has promised
me that she never will while I live. There is one little clause
in my will that I will read now, for I like to make people
happy, and I am going to make a mother happy, free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
anxiety about what her child will do when she is gone. This
is the clause, 'To the owner of the pen with which I wrote
this will, I bequeath five hundred dollars.'"</p>

<p>"Why, what is there in that to cry about? Bless my
heart, I thought I was going to make you all happy, and
here you are all shedding tears."</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle, uncle, you have made us happy. These are
tears of joy and gladness. How noble, how generous, how
good!"</p>

<p>"Just like him," said the other gentleman.</p>

<p>"This to me! Oh, Mr. Lovetree, this to the poor widow!
This to my daughter!"</p>

<p>"To me, mother, to me? Does it mean me? Yes! Oh,
mother, may I kiss him?"</p>

<p>Before anybody could say no, if they had been disposed to,
Stella was in his arms, and who shall say, that to one of his
wealth, that moment was not cheaply purchased for five hundred
dollars. Happiness is contagious. Those who feel it, feel
as though they would like to make everybody else feel just so.
Stella did, for she reached out one hand and drew her mother
to the same enfolding arms, and then Athalia enfolded them all,
until it seemed to my dim-growing eyes that four exceedingly
happy people were blending all in one. Feeling how useless
is a fifth wheel to a vehicle already having four, and feeling
too a sort of choking sensation, as though the air of the street
would be beneficial, while this scene was on, I went off.</p>

<p>When I had breathed the fresh air long enough to recover
my equilibrium of thoughts, one came into my mind that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
might do something to increase the happiness of the full hearts
I had just left. With this new idea in my mind I took my
way directly to Mrs. Laylor's. Of course I found the storm
had passed. A May morning could not be more calm and
pleasant. Of course I was a welcome visitor. I had ordered
a bottle of wine the night before, that paid my footing. I had
spent money for one sin, and apparently seemed willing to
spend more for another, and that always makes welcome guests,
because profit can be made out of such visitors. I had an
object in my course the night before; I had nothing of that
kind to accomplish to-night, and so I ordered no wine. I looked
serious, earnest, determined, and asked Mrs. Laylor for a
private interview. It is not necessary to inflict the particulars
upon my readers; it will be only interesting to them to know
that one of the results of the talk did add to the happiness of
those whom I had just left already very happy, for just as
Lovetree was in the act of kissing good-night to Athalia, there
came a rap to the door, it was a porter's rap; his load was a
trunk, a bandbox and a square bundle. The bundle was opened
first, its contents were now doubly dear, and Athalia longed to
show it to her uncle. It was the old family Bible. Everything
had been sent but the watch. That was irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>As I was leaving Mrs. Laylor's, with the porter and Athalia's
trunk, I met Frank Barkley and had five minutes talk with him.
As we parted, he said: "Depend upon it I shall claim my bet,
and the stake is in the hands of a friend who will fork over."</p>

<p>The next morning Athalia met with another surprise. The
three had just finished breakfast, and sat talking over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
strange events of the last day or two, congratulating each
other upon their singular good fortune, and laying out plans
for the day, while awaiting the momentarily expected arrival
of Mr. Lovetree. Mrs. May and Stella were to go out and
look up a place for the "little shop," which was to hold an
assortment of just such goods as she had been accustomed to
sell out of her basket, to which her mother was to add her nice
shirt collars, and perhaps the work of some other poor woman
who might be in need of assistance; and Athalia and her uncle
were to go "house hunting," a very common employment in
New York, for he was going to set her up in a business that she
could live by, and have a house for herself and him too, when
he was in the city, and pretty soon he hoped that would be all
the time; it should be as soon as he could get his Western
business settled up; but she should have a house and take a
few boarders, and always keep a room for him, and he would
always call that home; "and we shall be so happy," says she,
"and if he is sick I will take care of him, and if I am sick I
know he will be kind to me, he looks just as though he
would; don't you think so, Mrs. May?"</p>

<p>"Indeed he does; and you will be so happy, but I do not
know as you will be quite so happy as Stella and I shall be,
when we get a-going. I am happy now, only one thing
troubles me a little, I do not know what I am going to do for
a little money for present necessities. I had just paid my
month's rent, ten dollars in advance, and bought a piece of
linen for my work, and Stella had laid out all of her little
stock, and now we are quite out. If you had money as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
once had, I should know very well what to do. I should ask
you for a loan of five dollars, and I know very well what you
would say; no, you would not say anything, you would jump
up and run to the little drawer, the left-hand top drawer of
the bureau, I can almost see it now, and then you would say,
'there, there it is, go along, I don't want you to stop to thank
me.' But that time has past away. I suppose I shall have to
do what we poor folks often have to do, go to the pawnbroker
again.</p>

<p>"Your trouble, Mrs. May, is just mine too; I want a few
dollars so bad that I do not know what to do, and I was about
to ask you; I do not like to ask my uncle, so soon, and would
not on my own account, but will on yours."</p>

<p>"No, no, no, do not, I can get along very well, I can pawn
the linen, I shall not want that for a few days."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, do not say anything more, I have made up my
mind, and here he comes, so it is too late for argument."</p>

<p>There was a rap, and as they did not expect anybody else,
of course it must be her uncle; who else should it be? but it
was not. It was the same porter who was there last evening.
He did not bring any trunk or bundle, he simply brought a
letter and a very small package; a letter addressed, "Lucy
Smith."</p>

<p>Athalia was on the point of denying it, but then she thought
that Mrs. May and Stella both knew that was the name she
was known by at Mrs. Laylor's. Still she blushed and trembled.
She blushed to think that she had once said of her first
name, "I never shall change that." It is a sad thing for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
girl to change that. She trembled at the thought of having
any of her old acquaintances, who knew her by that name,
write to her or speak to her as friends, for they were only friends
of days which she would gladly blot out of memory&mdash;days of sin
and shame, which she looked back upon with horror, as she felt
their deep degradation. She trembled still more when she
opened the letter, and saw that the signature was Frank Barkley.
She felt faint, and her eyes grew dim, for she felt that she
was still pursued&mdash;"the guilty flee when no man pursueth"&mdash;by
one with whom she had sinned, and she felt that it was a
renewal of the proposition to sin again. She saw the name,
and the "Dear Lucy" with which it commenced, she saw no
more, she could see no more, and so she handed the letter
to Mrs. May, with an "oh, dear!"</p>

<p>Mrs. May read it, and then <i>she</i> said, "Oh, dear," but it was
a very different "Oh, dear," from Athalia's. It was an "Oh,
dear, what a fortune," and then she handed the letter back to
Athalia, and said, "read, you will not find it very bad." Her
joyous smile reassured the fainting, trembling Athalia, and she
read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dear Lucy.</span><br>
</p>

<p>"Dearer to me now than ever. I have heard from a mutual
friend all about it. First, forgive me for the wrong I have done you. I
shall not do it again. Blush not to meet me in the street or church, for
by no look or word will I ever seek to renew our acquaintance. I know
you now, I never did before, and I feel that I am not worthy to renew
that acquaintance. I am a man of the world, and enjoy what my own
class call pleasures. I have enjoyed pleasant hours with you, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
never enjoyed a night as I have the last. I have been alone in my room
all night. I have been thinking. I have thought how much myself and
my associates have done to swell the class of females whom we look upon
with contempt, as they pass us in the street. I have found that it is
good to think. I have thought a great deal of you, and of your history,
as I gleaned it partly from you and partly from Mrs. Laylor, but the last
and best part from your friend. Believe me when I say that I am most
sincerely glad that you have escaped from a life which I had persuaded
you to adopt. I was selfish then. I am sober now.</p>

<p>"Of course you know I have won my bet. I have got the money. I
do not need it, you do. It is your due and much more from that avaricious
woman who deceived you so bitterly. You lost your watch. It
was partly my fault. If I had not believed the lies told of you, it would
not have happened, for then in a spirit of retaliation, I had not been false
to you, nor you to me, and you would not have made the acquaintance
of the gambler who stole your watch. I cannot return that, but I send
one in its place. I also send you my check for the money won, and the
same sum which was staked against it. If you are ever in need hereafter
remember your real, truly sincere friend,</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Frank Barkley.</span>"<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She looked up with tearful eyes, and simply said, "Mrs. May,
you will not have to go to the pawnbroker's to-day. Take
this check and go to the bank, or I will write a note to a friend
who will cash it in a minute, it needs no endorsement, it is
payable to the bearer, and you shall have one hundred and I
the other. Now let us look at the watch." They did look
at it, and of course admire it, and then Mr. Lovetree came in,
and then the letter was read again, and then he said, "the
fellow has got a heart after all, it has only been spoiled by
bad associations; he has got a good start now in the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
path, and I shall make it my business to look him up and help
him along. Do you know, Athalia, where he lives?"</p>

<p>"I have his card, sir, in my trunk."</p>

<p>"Very well, give it to me at your leisure, and we will let
him know that the pearls of that letter have not been cast
before the very worst sort of pigs."</p>

<p>Then Stella was going out to get the check changed, and
then he said, "Never mind, give it to me," and then he put
it in his pocket-book very carefully, and put that away in his
left-hand pocket&mdash;he had a place for everything; and then he
put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and took out fifty
dollars in gold, and handed that to Athalia, with the remark
that he would bring her the balance to-morrow, that that was
as much as she would want to-day; and then he said, as he
saw her slipping it slyly into Mrs. May's hand, "Oh, that is
it, is it?" and then Mrs. May said, "she <i>must</i> tell, and then she
did tell all about her want of money, and how she used to go
to Athalia when she was in want, and now, when neither of
them had any, it did seem as though the good spirit had
opened the heart of that man to repentance and good works,
just when it was most needed."</p>

<p>And then they all went out, Mrs. May and Stella to hunt
for the shop, which they found and had in operation in a
week, and which was the foundation of a fortune, for it prospered
wonderfully. The ball only needed a start, it would
accumulate at every roll. It is accumulating still. I wish a
few more benevolent old gentlemen would take each one of
them a little girl out of the street, and set the ball to rolling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Good bye, Mrs. May&mdash;good bye, Stella. "We may never
meet again, but we never shall forget you, good-hearted little
girl, and kind, blessed, good mother. Thy good works have
their reward."</p>

<p>Athalia and her uncle found a house. We have heard of
that before, from Maggie; we shall hear of them again, in
some of these shifting "Scenes."</p>

<p>I shall draw the curtain now. It may remain down for one
or two or more years, what does it matter to the reader? It
is facts that he wants, he cares nothing for time, or which
scene comes first. If the reader is a woman, she cares
neither for time nor facts, so that the story is good.</p>

<p>What next?</p>

<p>Look in the next chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>.</p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="h3">NEW SCENES AND NEW CHARACTERS.</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
Would man observingly distil it out."</p></blockquote>

<p>That was well exemplified in the last chapter. It may be
in this. If any of the readers of these "Scenes" suppose the
writer lost sight of the chance to do good, and the right time
to do it, that the death of "Little Katy," offered, they are
quite mistaken. Although he may not be able to do with his
own purse, he has a way of procuring others to do a part
that is so much needed to be done. He found that Katy had
an aunt in the city, who was able to do for her sister, and he
took the preliminary steps to restore the poor, lost sheep to the
fold from which she had strayed. That he should have lost
sight of her for a little while, in the busy whirl of city life, is
not surprising. That the reader has been left in suspense,
while he has had many other scenes before him, the author
hopes he will not regret. We do not travel old, beaten paths,
in this volume.</p>

<p>As the subject is new, so is the way of illustrating it.
Now, let us walk on.</p>

<p>"There has been a black woman here twice this evening
after you, and she says, she must have the sight of ye afore
she sleeps, any how."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a piece of Irish information, which met me as I
opened the door, one night, in rather a melancholy mood, for
I was as yet supperless, tired, sleepy, and about half sick,
from breathing fetid air four or five hours, while visiting the
poorest of the city poor, the denizens of Cow Bay.</p>

<p>Now, it must not be understood that Mrs. McTravers
intended to tell me that the Ethiopian female, who had twice
called at my abode, and declared that "she must have the
sight of me before she slept," had the least desire to gouge
out my eyes. On the contrary, she was only anxious to have
a sight of the ugly visage I own, and come within speaking
distance of me.</p>

<p>"What for? What did she want, Mrs. McTravers?"</p>

<p>"Sure, your honor, it's not the likes of me knows what a
lady wants with a lone gentleman at this time o'night."</p>

<p>If I did not swear, I had some very hard thoughts at the
blundering awkwardness of this woman, or her entire inability
to convey ideas by language, so that I could understand
them "at this time of night."</p>

<p>She proceeded to give a most minute description of "the
black woman," how she looked, and talked, and dressed.</p>

<p>Who could it be? I run over in my mind all of my African
female acquaintances&mdash;not large&mdash;but not one of them
answered the description given by Mrs. McTravers.</p>

<p>I was about proceeding up stairs, when she said, "ye'll
surely go and see the sick lady." I had a slight internal
intimation that I was nearly losing my patience.</p>

<p>"Mrs. McTravers, what is it about a sick lady? You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
not told me a word about anybody, sick or well, except a negro
woman, and you have not told me what she wanted."</p>

<p>"And sure, then, I thought you knew all about it. The
wench said you knew the lady."</p>

<p>"I know a good many, but how can I tell which one of
my acquaintances this may be?"</p>

<p>"Why sure, then I thought you would know when I told
you where she lived."</p>

<p>"In the name of common sense, Mrs. McTravers, if you
know who the sick woman is, or where she lives, or what she
wants, why don't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't I going to, only you put me into such a flusteration?
There, sure, that'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>And she handed me a piece of paper, on which was written,
in a very delicate lady hand, though evidently nervous,
"Madame De Vrai, 53 W&mdash;street."</p>

<p>I am sure I must have looked like a living specimen of confusion
worse confounded. The name I had never heard before.
The street was an unknown locality. I only knew it was
a street on the west side of the city, somewhere, and whether
it had such a number as "53," was entirely too much for my
arithmetic. I determined not to go. Still there was a mystery,
that natural curiosity prompted me to solve. Who could
it be? "Did the black woman say that I was acquainted with
the lady?"</p>

<p>"She did that, and that you had been very kind to her.
God bless you for that same, for being so to a stranger and a
foreigner too at that. The black woman said you was a blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
good man to the poor lady, and a father to her childer,
dead and alive."</p>

<p>Was anything ever so provoking as the stolidity of an Irish
servant. Every word she uttered made the mystery still darker.
I knew no Madame De Vrai; never heard of the name
before in my life&mdash;took no credit to myself for any special
act of kindness to the poor in general, and certainly could
not call to mind any act of my life that would warrant me
in appropriating the blessing so heartily offered for my acceptance.
As to being the father of the poor woman's "childer,
dead and alive," I declared emphatically that it was just no
such thing. I would not own them. So I called for something
to eat, and determined to go to bed, fully satisfied that
African blunders and Irish ditto, duly mixed, had made one
this time too large for my mastery, either with my very
common name, or by a mistake in the street or number; or
else somebody else had undertaken to father this family, and
now desired to shift the responsibility; certainly I had not,
could not, would not father them. So I sat munching and
musing over my bread and butter and cold water, of the scenes
of the evening which I had witnessed.</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven I knew what had become of her," I
thought aloud.</p>

<p>"Who?" said a kind voice at my elbow. "What lady are
you so anxious about now. Any of your Five Point prot&eacute;g&eacute;s?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You have guessed it exactly. None other."</p>

<p>"Is that what you have been looking for to-night. Do tell
me of your visit. What have you seen?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"More of human misery than I ever saw before in one night.
Would you like to hear the detail?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it may do me good to hear how others live, and if
worse than I do, it may make me more contented with my
own lot."</p>

<p>"Worse than you do? Why, madam, have you not all
that is necessary to make life comfortable around you. A
neat, airy, well-furnished house, plenty of room, plenty to eat,
good bed to sleep on, good baths for evening ablution or
morning renovation, and above all the other luxuries of city
life, plenty of that greatest of New York's blessings, the Croton
water? Now listen how and where others live. In a
close, dirty, pent up court, are piles of old bricks and frame
houses, perfect rat harbors, filled with human beings, men,
women, children, from cellar bottom to garret peak, poor beyond
the power of imagination, dirty to a degree that is sickening
to behold, criminal through necessity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not necessity. Nobody is necessitated to be criminal."</p>

<p>"You are simply mistaken. I repeat, criminal by necessity.
So educated from childhood, that they know of no way
to live, but by the beggar's trade, or pilferer's, or prostitute's
crime. Such are the parents, such must be the children.
There is no hope otherwise. They are sent out in infancy to
beg, and early taught to 'pick up things;' the place of education
is the street, the watch house, or city prison."</p>

<p>"Why don't their parents send them to school?"</p>

<p>"Why should they? They never went to such a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
themselves, and care not that their children should go. They
care for nothing but rum, and that the builders of prisons,
and hangers of murderers, take care they shall have the
means of getting. The imprisonment and hanging, is the
sequence of the license system."</p>

<p>"But you were to tell us what you saw this evening."</p>

<p>"Human misery. The houses of the city poor. The
locality is Cow Bay. It opens upon Anthony street at the
North West angle of the Five Points."</p>

<p>The first <i>home</i> we entered was a cellar room twelve by
twenty feet, quite below the surface, and only just high
enough to stand up under the beams of the floor over head,
while at every step the water oozed up through the boards
we trod upon. At one end was the narrow, muddy stairway
and door, by which we entered, and at the other a fire-place.</p>

<p>On one side two windows with places for three panes of
glass to each, gave all the light and ventilation afforded to
the four families who occupied the room. These consisted of
two men and their wives, two single women, an old woman
and her three boys, and a young girl as a boarder. There
were four sleeping places, called beds, upon forms, elevated
above the floor, for none could sleep on that on account of
the water.</p>

<p>"Do you always have the water as bad as it is now?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"Bad is it? An I wish then you could see it after a big
rain, when the water is over the floor entirely fornent the
the door."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have these women husbands?"</p>

<p>"These two with the young children have."</p>

<p>"What do they do for a living?"</p>

<p>"One of them jobs about&mdash;but he is on the Island now."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Just nothing at all, yer honor, he is as kind a husband as
ever lived, only when he takes a drop too much once in a
while."</p>

<p>"Hould your tongue now, Ellen Maguire, you know your
husband is drunk every time he can get liquor, and that is as
often as he can coax anybody that has got money into that
dirty hole at the corner&mdash;Cale Jones's grocery. He is a burner,
sir?"</p>

<p>"A burner. What is that?"</p>

<p>"He asks some one to go and take a drink with him,
and then tells him to call for what he likes, and so he drinks
and drinks, thinking all the time it is a treat, till he gets
ready to go, and then the fellow who keeps the shop stops him
and makes him pay for all the liquor the company have
drank."</p>

<p>"Don't he refuse?"</p>

<p>"What's the use? He is burnt, and must stand it. If he
refuse, they will take his coat, or hat, or shoes. If he gets
off with his breeches on he is lucky."</p>

<p>"What does this woman's husband do to support his
family?"</p>

<p>"Deil a bit can I tell. It is not for me to pry into peoples'
business who pay the rint like honest folks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p><p>"The rent. How much rent do you pay for this
room?"</p>

<p>"Fifty cents a week for each of us&mdash;that is two dollars in
all, every Monday morning in advance; sure, you may well
believe that, if you know Billy Crown, the agent. It's never
a poor woman that he lets slip; if she was dying, and never
a mouthful of bread or drop of anything in the house, the
rint must be paid."</p>

<p>"Well, these women what do they do?"</p>

<p>"What should a lone woman do? she must live. There is
but one way."</p>

<p>"Have you a husband?"</p>

<p>"The Lord be thanked, no. It is enough for me to live
with me boys. What would I do if I had a drunken husband
to support out of me arnings?"</p>

<p>Sure enough. What should any woman want of a drunken
husband? Let us look above ground. Perchance misery
only dwells in dark, low, damp cellars. Up, then, to the very
garret of the same house. It is divided into three rooms, one
is ten feet square with one window, without fire-place or stove.
What may be inside we know not, for a strong hasp and padlock
guard the treasure. Back of this, through a two feet wide
passage, is another room, eight feet by twelve. This is partly
under the roof, has a dilapidated fire-place and broken window.
This is inhabited by a black man and his wife. There is a
bed, a table, dishes and two chairs, and an air of neatness,
contrasting strongly with the cellar.</p>

<p>By the side of this is another room inhabited by a negro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and his white wife, and a white man and wife. Did you ever
see four uglier beasts in one cage? The white man is a hyena;
his wife a tiger; the negro a hippopotamus; his wife a sort
of human tortoise; the dirt, representing the shell, out of
which the vicious head poked itself, glaring at the intruders
upon her premises, with a look that plainly said, Oh, how I
should like to bite and claw you, and strip off those clean
clothes, and spoil that face, and put out those eyes, and make
ye as dirty and ugly and miserable as I am. The black man
was social, courteous and intelligent. He was a cobbler, and
diligently plied his hammer and awl. With a kind master
and well cared for, he would be a faithful, good servant. He
has no faculty to take care of himself. By nature the slave
of one of nature's strongest passions, he has sunk down into
slavery to this hard-shell woman, and the tool of his designing hyena
and tiger room-mates. The white man looked as if he
were counting the contents of our pockets, and what chance
there would be for a grab at our watches.</p>

<p>The shape of this room was peculiar. Take a large watermelon,
cut it in quarters, cut one of those across&mdash;the flesh
sides will represent the floor and one wall&mdash;the cross-cut the
end, where there is a fire-place&mdash;the rind is the roof and other
side of the room, through which at the butt end, there is a
window. There is no bedstead, or place for one. There is no
table, or occasion for any. Two boxes and a stool serve for
chairs. The bedding is very scarce, but the floor is of soft
wood, and the weather is warm. Each of these rooms rents
for three dollars a month, always in advance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>Now let us go down the rotten stairway to the next floor.
Though what we have seen is bad, we may yet say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The worst is not<br></span>
<span class="i0">So long as we can say, 'this is the worst.'"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>What have we here?</p>

<p>Something worse. Yes, for coupled with poverty and
crime, is fanatical hatred of everything that is not worse
than itself. Let us rap at this door. A gruff woman's
voice bids us enter. We are met by an insolent defiant scowl
and an angry "what do you want here?"</p>

<p>"Good woman, is some one sick here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What of that. Nobody wants the like of you,
with your pious faces and 'good woman,' prowling about at
this time of night. You're after nothing good, any one
might swear that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can give you some good advice for your sick
child."</p>

<p>"Give your advice when we ask it. Haven't we got
Father Mullany to give us advice, and he a good doctor too.
I tell you we don't want any miserable heretics in the
house and me child a dying. And who have I to thank for
it?"</p>

<p>"Surely, madam, we cannot tell. Perhaps you can, or your
husband, where is he?"</p>

<p>If a dog were thrown among the whelps in a wolf's lair, it
would not arouse the dam quicker than these words did this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
human she-wolf. She sprang towards us, foaming with rage.
A stout cane in my strong right hand caught her eye, and she
stood at bay.</p>

<p>"What was she so mad at you and your companion for?
Did she know either of you?"</p>

<p>"She knew us by sight, or rather she knew him as one of
the active helpers of the Missionary, Mr. Pease, the House of
Industry, and the Five Points Mission. What more should
she know to hate us? She knew we were not of her faith;
that we believed not in the efficacy of holy water and confession,
to work out sin; that we did not kneel and receive
a consecrated wafer with 'extreme unction', and so she hated
us with all the fervent rancor of religious hate. She hated
us for our mission of good; for she knew we hated what she
dearly loved&mdash;drunkenness and all its concomitant evils. She
hated us with that envious hate of depravity, which would
sink everything to its own level. She knew that we would
take her dying child to a clean bed and airy room, and give
it food and medicine, and nurse it into life, and she hated us
for that."</p>

<p>"How could she? How could a mother be so wicked to
her poor sick child? I am sure if I could not take care of
mine, I would trust it with anybody who would save its life."
Thus will say more than one Christian mother.</p>

<p>Think&mdash;be careful&mdash;be not uncharitable&mdash;good mother.
Would you let it go with those who saved its life to be
reared with them&mdash;taught their creed&mdash;perhaps to hate yours?
Certainly if taught the principles of temperance&mdash;virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>&mdash;neatness&mdash;her
child could not love its drunken mother, in her
rags and dirt and life of sin.</p>

<p>"But then the child would be brought up by religious
teachers, and taught to be a Christian."</p>

<p>Yes, a Protestant Christian; she is a good Catholic.
Would you willingly give up your child if it were to be reared
a Pagan, a Mahometan, or even a Jew?</p>

<p>"No! I would let it die."</p>

<p>There spoke the Five Points mother. Sooner than it
should go into a Protestant house, she would see it die.</p>

<p>Alas! poor human nature; yes, poor human nature, sunk
down into those depths of misery and degradation, yet every
one of them are our brothers and sisters, who are rearing up
children like themselves, as true as like produces like, while
we look on, shrug our comfortably-wrapped shoulders, and
"Thank God we are not like one of these," and yet never
give, out of our abundance, one cent to make one of them
like one of us.</p>

<p>"Well, what of her husband?"</p>

<p>"My husband, is it?" she said, as she stood glaring at us;
"my husband? Go, look in your city prison, you old gray-headed
villains, where ye or the likes of ye, murdered him
without judge or jury. Did you try him for his life? No.
Had he been a murderer? No. Had he done any crime?
No. You licensed him to sell liquor, and he drank too much&mdash;I
drank too much&mdash;what else can you expect, when you
set fools to play with live coals, but they will burn themselves?
What next? What is the natural consequence of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
drunk? A quarrel. I know it. Don't ask me what I get
drunk for; I know you did not speak, but I saw it in your
eye&mdash;yes, your eye&mdash;turn it away&mdash;I cannot bear it, it looks
right into my soul. Don't look at me that way, or I shall
cry, and I had rather die than do that. It would kill me to
cry for such as you, who murdered my poor husband. You
licensed him to sell rum, in the first place, to make other
wives miserable with drunken husbands&mdash;mine was not
drunken then, and I did not have to live in such a hole as
this&mdash;look around you, ye murdering villains. What do you
see?&mdash;poverty, filth, and rags; starvation, misery, crime&mdash;on
that bed is my dying boy&mdash;that is nothing. Let him die, I
am glad of it&mdash;the priest has made it all right with him.
Now, look in that bed, rum-selling, licensing whelps that you
are&mdash;that is worse than the dying boy in the other&mdash;see what
we have bought with our money paid to your excise office.
See what a mother is sunk to by rum. Yes, I do drink it&mdash;why
do your eyes ask the question? I do drink, and will
again. What else have I got to live for? What lower hole
can I sink to? Me, a mother. A mother! Mother of that
shameless girl, do you see her, there in that bed, before her
mother's eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and a pretty looking, bright-eyed girl she is."</p>

<p>"Bright-eyed. Yes, bright-eyed. I would to Heaven she
had none&mdash;that she had been born blind. Her bright eyes
have been her ruin&mdash;a curse to her and the mother that bore
her&mdash;they are a curse to any poor girl among such villains as
you are. Ye are men&mdash;how many hearts have you broken?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>&mdash;withered,
trampled on?&mdash;there, go, go. I hate the sight
of all men."</p>

<p>"Who is this man I see with your daughter; is he her
husband?"</p>

<p>"Husband! husband! Do the like of her get husbands?
Where is my husband?"</p>

<p>"We cannot tell, can you?"</p>

<p>"Tell! who can tell where a man is that died drunk&mdash;died&mdash;murdered
in your man-killing city prison, and the priest
not there to give him absolution. What had he done?
What crime? Drank rum that you licensed him to sell&mdash;beat
me because I drank too. What next? Next come
your dirty police&mdash;the biggest scoundrels in the city&mdash;mad at
my husband because he would not 'touch their palms,' and
drag him to the Tombs&mdash;a right name&mdash;good name&mdash;true
name&mdash;Tombs indeed&mdash;a tomb to my husband."</p>

<p>"Did he die there?"</p>

<p>"No! he was murdered there. Look here. Can you
read? Yes, yes, I know ye can. So can I. Do you see
that account of prisoners dying by suffocation&mdash;poisoned by
carbonic acid gas&mdash;there, read it,"&mdash;and she thrust a crumpled
paper before us&mdash;"read how ye reform drunkards&mdash;shut
them up in prison cells, and in spite of their prayers, and
groans, and dying cries for air, ye let them die. Are ye not
murderers? Do you see that name? That is&mdash;that was my
husband. Ha, ha, ha! Now, what is he, where is he? Don't
answer&mdash;I know your answer; but if he is in hell, who
sent him there? Who, who, who?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>And she sank down upon one of the pallets which were
spread over the floor, in a paroxysm of wild, delirious grief
and rage, speechless as her dying boy, lying unheeded and
unheeding, by her side. What could we do? Nothing
here; much elsewhere; and we looked up and registered a
vow, that much as she hated us for what we had not done,
yet had permitted our fellows to do without crying out
against them, that she should be avenged. If we could do
nothing here&mdash;if we could not pull down the sturdy oak by
taking hold of its topmost branches, yet, although its mighty
strength defies our weak efforts thus applied, we can and will
dig around its roots&mdash;we will take away the life-sustaining
earth&mdash;and that strong tree shall be made to feel our power&mdash;it
shall wither, dry up, and die, and time shall rot down
its strong trunk, and the place that once knew it, shall know
it no more.</p>

<p>This then is our pledge, made over that dying boy, and,
worse than by murder, widowed mother, and here now we
redeem it. Here we expose the hydra-headed monster&mdash;the
orphan and widow-maker&mdash;the property, health, and virtue-destroyer.
Sad, harrowing as these scenes of wretchedness
and misery are, they must be laid open to the gaze of the
world. "Wounds must be seen to be healed." Weak nerves
tremble at the idea that physicians cut and carve the dead,
talking, aye laughing, as freely over the quiet heart and still
nerves in the dissecting-room, as the butcher over his beef
upon the market house block; yet without the dissecting of
one and butchering of the other, how should the maimed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
healed, or meat-eating multitude be fed? So let us on with
our panorama of scenes from life in New York.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">

<span class="caption">OLD PLATO COOKING HOT CORN.</span>
</div>

<p>Let us open this door. Ah! we have been here before.</p>

<p>The room is seven by twelve feet, under the roof, which comes
down at one end within a foot of the floor. There is a broken,
dirty, window in the roof, at the right hand of the door as we
enter on the side. No fire-place or stove, no table, only two
broken chairs&mdash;a very old bureau&mdash;a dilapidated trunk&mdash;a
band-box&mdash;a few articles of female apparel&mdash;some poor dishes
and a few cooking utensils&mdash;used upon a little portable furnace
standing in the room&mdash;a poor old bedstead and straw bed in one
corner&mdash;a child's cot and a doll; and yet the only occupant of
the room is an old negro man, who sits of nights upon cold
stones, crying Hot Corn. We look about wonderingly, peering
in here and there, but except the old man we see no one.</p>

<p>"She gone, massa, clean gone&mdash;cry old eyes out when I come
home next day arter dat one, you know massa, which one dis
child mean&mdash;sad day&mdash;don't like to mention him, massa&mdash;give
me chaw terbacca, massa&mdash;come home and find her and
little sis&mdash;nice child dat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You found her."</p>

<p>"No sir, found her gone&mdash;done gone entirely&mdash;key in old
place where I knew where to find him&mdash;everything all here&mdash;no
word for old Plato&mdash;what I give to see her once more&mdash;to
see little Sissee&mdash;Oh that I knew where she was. Oh, oh, oh."</p>

<p>"And would to Heaven we could tell what has become of
her."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who?" said the lady who had been listening with intense
interest to my narrative.</p>

<p>"True, I had forgotten to tell you that we stood in the
chamber where little Katy died. Where that last sweet kiss
of an angel was given&mdash;where the candle seemed to the dying
innocent to go out&mdash;where she said, 'Good bye&mdash;mother&mdash;don't
drink&mdash;any more&mdash;good b&mdash;' but before the word was
finished, there was another angel added to the heavenly host
around the throne of God."</p>

<p>It was here that the scene, which the artist has so touchingly
illustrated upon the opposite page, transpired. Turn
your thoughts a moment from this page to that and look upon
the picture. Turn back to Chapter VI., "The Home of Little
Katy," and read over the story of the death of that poor innocent,
and you will better appreciate the description and illustration
of that home and that dying scene.</p>

<p>'Twas then and there that that fallen mother was touched
by a power greater than human strength&mdash;'twas then as she
knelt over her dead child, she had said, "never, never, never,
will I touch that accursed poison cup. Oh, God," she prayed,
"take my child, my wronged and murdered child, and I will
not repine; I will thank thee; I will praise thy name as my
mother taught me to praise thee; as she loved and blessed,
and prayed for me all her life, even after my fall, although
hastened to her grave by my sin. Oh, my mother, forgive
me; oh, my child, forgive me; oh, my God, forgive me, but
let me live to repent, and be a mother and a blessing to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
living child. Oh, my sister, where are you, cold and unforgiving
sister, but for you I had not been here&mdash;why could you
not forgive. Oh, God, canst thou?"</p>

<p>What was that still small voice that seemed to say in our
ears, as she ceased speaking, and lay sobbing upon the breast
of little Katy?</p>

<p>"Yes, sister, he can, he will, he has; rise, thy sins are forgiven
thee."</p>

<p>Did she hear it too? Else, why did she instantly rise up,
with dry eyes and calm, almost happy features?</p>

<p>It was then that I gained from her the secret of her sister's
name, upon a promise that I did not keep&mdash;I could not keep&mdash;it
was not my duty to keep it. But where has she gone?
Has her sister got my letter?&mdash;has her heart at last been
touched?&mdash;has she taken her away? If so, why has she not
told me where? Long days and nights of anxiety have come
and gone, and she comes not back to her home. Has despair
worked its wonted result, and does the ocean wave roll
over the mother and her child, in a suicide's watery grave?</p>

<p>"What would I give to know?"</p>

<p>"You must wait," said our sympathizing friend.</p>

<p>Yes, we must wait. Yet "Hope deferred maketh the heart
sick."</p>

<p>"Have you been to see the woman who sent for you to-day?"</p>

<p>"No! It is nobody that I know. Some mistake."</p>

<p>Yes, it was some mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"But she sent her name by the black woman, when she
came the second time."</p>

<p>"I know it, but it is no one that I know. The name is
utterly unknown to me. It is a French name. Some mistake."
There was a mistake.</p>

<p>What prompted me to look again at the name? I knew it
as well as I should if I looked at that paper a hundred times.
Yet I was prompted to look at it once more. The desire was
irresistible. Who has ever felt a longing after something
unseen, unknown, unheard, undefined, something that he feels
as though he must have or die, yet knows not how to obtain,
may realize the intensity of my desire to see that paper once
more. Where is it? This pocket, and that is searched, turned
wrong side out, and turned back again; the table, floor,
books, papers, hunted over, but nowhere can it be found.
What has spirited it away? It could not blow out of the
window, for there is no air stirring.</p>

<p>"It must," said the lady, "have gone down on the tea-tray&mdash;I
will call Bridget."</p>

<p>A woman is worth a dozen men for thought, and this time
she thought truly. It had gone down that way, and gone
into the slop-bucket, and into the street.</p>

<p>"Bridget, will you take a lamp and go out and see if you
can find it."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, certainly, and I think I can."</p>

<p>Blessed hope. My friend was curious to know, what in
the world I wanted of that piece of paper? "You say, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
remember the name and number perfectly, and yet you act as
though it was of the utmost value. I recollect seeing you
once when you had lost a twenty dollar bill, as cool and careless
as though it had been as worthless as this little scrap of
paper. Now you act strangely, what can it mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I know I want to see that paper. I cannot
tell why."</p>

<p>"Well, you will soon be gratified. She has found it. Do
wait, don't be so impatient to meet her at the foot of the stairs."</p>

<p>I did not wait though. I gave one glance at the soiled scrap&mdash;it
was enough&mdash;the pen and ink name had faded out, but
there were three words&mdash;talismanic words&mdash;in pencil marks,
evidently added as an after-thought by her who had first
written her name in ink&mdash;words which sent me out of the
door, and half way to the next street, before that voice, sent
after me from the stair-head, of "Do stop him, Bridget, he
is crazy, to go out in this rain," had reached my ears. It did
not stop me&mdash;I was gone beyond the reach of her voice.
The girl stood amazed. She looked at the scrap of paper
with about the same degree of astonishment as did the
savage tribe at the white man's paper talk.</p>

<p>"Bring it to me, Bridget."</p>

<p>"He is gone, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know he is gone, bring it to me."</p>

<p>"I can't ma'am, he is gone."</p>

<p>"Not him, Bridget, the paper, the paper. I want to see
what is on it, that has driven that man out at this hour, in
such a rainy night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl looked at the door just closed, shutting the man
out in the rain, then she examined the corner where the cane
and umbrella usually stood, to be sure they had gone out too,
that she had not been dreaming all the while; then she gave
a glance at the table to satisfy herself that the hat had gone
with the cane and umbrella; then she looked again at the
paper, to see what magic power that might possess, to do
such midnight deeds. Papers have great power. Poor
Bridget, she could not read, but she could feel, and she knew
that there was a cause&mdash;the effect she had seen.</p>

<p>"Bridget, what is the matter? are you frightened to death?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am&mdash;only speechless. Did you
ever see the like? that that little dirty scrap of paper, I
picked out of the gutter, should send the gentleman out of
the house faster than I ever saw him go before in the year
and a half I have been with you. What does it mean?
Will you please to tell me, what these little marks mean?
What does it read? There now, you can see them good.
Please, read them to me, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Little Katy's Mother."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and quite enough. I wonder not he went so quickly.
I almost fancy I can&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'By the lamp dimly burning, or the pale moonlight&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">See where he goes&mdash;'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>almost past whole house fronts at a single stride. If a cart
is in the way at the crossing he will not go around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>&mdash;two
steps and he is over. If there is a bell at the door, take
care, or the wires will crack. If a knocker, it will thunder
loud this night. Woe to the watchman, who, thinking he
may be a runaway burglar, puts out a hand to stop him in
his walk. The bull, that butted the locomotive, made equal
speed in his intent. He went down&mdash;the steam went on."</p>

<p>"Is he mad, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No, Bridget, only enthusiastic. If he is mad,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There is method in his madness,'<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>he is only very much interested about a woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am, I understand it now. I have seen gentlemen
often mad after women. I suppose little Katy, then,
is his child."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Bridget, you are all wrong. She is not his
child."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, ma'am, then, I suppose, she is somebody's else
child. And if her mother is an interesting woman, I don't
see as there is anything so very wrong about the matter.
What am I all wrong about, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Little Katy is dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, is she? I am sure then I am very sorry. Can I do
anything about helping to get her ready to be buried?"</p>

<p>"No, she was buried long ago. You may see her grave
some day in Greenwood Cemetery."</p>

<p>"I don't see, then, what was the gentleman's great hurry, if
nobody is sick and nobody to be buried."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the mother is sick&mdash;perhaps in want&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
some unknown power has drawn him to her assistance.
I have seen stranger things than that. This is a strange
world."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is, ma'am. And there is a strange noise in the
street." And she looked from the window.</p>

<p>"What can it be, Bridget, there is a crowd around our area
fence, and see, there is a woman under the steps by the basement
door. Go down and see what is the matter. Are you
afraid? Well then, I will go with you; it is somebody that
a parcel of brutal men and boys are persecuting. No matter
who, or what she is, she is a woman, and should be protected."</p>

<p>So down they went and she said to them, "Oh men, men,
where is your manhood, thus to hunt a woman through the
streets? Have you forgotten that mothers bore you in pain
into this world? Have you no daughters, no sisters, are you
savages&mdash;wolves&mdash;is this a lamb or stricken deer, that ye trail
by her bloody track?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said a bull pup looking boy, "she is drunk,
and we is just having a little fun with her, that is all."</p>

<p>God of mercy! Didst thou make man in thine own image,
and yet leave him void of that heavenly attribute&mdash;mercy!
Why, "a merciful man is merciful to his beast," and yet these
images of their Maker hunt this poor woman through the
streets of a Christian city, as savages hunt tigers through the
jungles of Africa&mdash;for fun. What for? "She is drunk." A
potent reason, surely. Who made her so? How came she
drunk? Who is she, what is she? No matter, she is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
woman, in distress at a woman's door, and she must, she shall
be protected. There is a commotion in the crowd. The
human blood-hounds are about to lose their prey&mdash;They want
more <i>fun</i>.</p>

<p>"Bring her out Bill, never mind the women&mdash;it is none of
their business&mdash;bring her out and let us see her run again.
She is a real '2.40' nag."</p>

<p>And they shouted and screamed like so many wild Indians.</p>

<p>What but savages are they? True they had white skins
and Christian clothes, and spoke the language of a civilized
nation, and dwelt in "one of the first cities in the world."
Yet they pursued a poor, young, helpless female, like a
hunted hare through the streets, and now press hard upon
her two protectors; one a delicate, sickly lady, the other a
timid servant girl, with a cry to Bill, the leader, to "bring
her out"&mdash;to drag her by force from where she has sunk
down upon the very threshold of a house which she hopes
may offer her protection, yet she dares not ask it. Shame
has overcome her, she buries her face in her hands as she sits
crouched up in a corner, but neither looks up nor speaks.
The crowd press forward, the servant shrinks back, the lady
stands firm, with a determination to protect or perish.</p>

<p>Can she do it? What can a woman without strength, do
against a pack of loosened blood-hounds, already licking their
chops with delight at the sight of their prey?</p>

<p>"Drag her out, some of ye, down there, why don't ye,"
screamed a human tiger, in the rear of the crowd; "don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
mind that woman, she is no better than the gal. Let me in
and I'll bring her."</p>

<p>A strong hand is laid upon the poor girl's arm, and for the
first time she looks up, but ventures not a word. The look was
enough. It appealed to a woman's heart for protection&mdash;an
appeal that never failed. How can she protect the helpless
with her feeble strength, against the brutal force of rum crazed
men and vicious boys, who shout, "drag her out, drag her out."</p>

<p>Will they do it? They heed not the appealing look of their
victim&mdash;their object of sport&mdash;<i>fun</i>&mdash;fun for them, death to
her. They heed not the appealing words of her who would
protect. God help you, poor soul, you have drank wine&mdash;you
are drunk in the streets at midnight&mdash;you have none but those
who are as weak as yourself, to save you, poor, timid, stricken
fawn.</p>

<p>"Drag her out, drag her out." How it rung in her ears!
How those terrible words went down into her soul!</p>

<p>Succor is at hand.</p>

<p>There was a shout, a yell, a horrid scream of anguish, a
few hurried oaths, a pushing, shoving, care-for-self-only struggle
among the crowd, as a shower of smoking water fell among
them, and they were gone.</p>

<p>The lady turned her eyes, and there stood Mrs. McTravers,
in her night cap, pail in hand, her effective engine of
war.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. McTravers, how could you scald them?"</p>

<p>"Didn't they deserve it, the brutes?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes; no, not so bad as that. I am afraid you have
put out their eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, never fear that. Didn't I timper it, like 'the wind
to the shorn lamb,' just warm enough to wash the faces of
the dirty spalpeens, and give them a good fright? How the
cowards did run. What were they afraid of? I had spent
all my ammunition in the first volley. This is nothing but
cold water, and that never hurt anybody. It is a pity the
scurvy dogs did not use more of it every day, and nothing
else. They would never chase poor girls through the streets,
if they drank nothing but water."</p>

<p>"Come, young woman, you can get up now and go home, if
you have any to go to, and if you have not, what are you
going to do with yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. McTravers, we will take her in and put her
to bed, and let her sleep till morning."</p>

<p>"Take her in? What, take a common street-walker in
to disgrace your house?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear, good, kind lady," said the object of
their conversation, now for the first time speaking. "I am no
street-walker&mdash;I am not what you take me for. Do not&mdash;pray
do not, force me to go into the street again to-night.
Let me lay here on the door-sill till daylight."</p>

<p>"Never! It shall never be said I refused to give shelter to
one of my own sex in distress, no matter what she is or has
been. Mrs. McTravers, she must have a bed in the house
to-night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to know then where you will find it.
Every bed in the house is full."</p>

<p>"I will give her mine then, and sleep myself on the floor."</p>

<p>"No, no, no, let me sleep on the floor&mdash;on the hearth&mdash;on
the stones in the back-yard, rather than go in the street
again, but I won't sleep in your bed."</p>

<p>"Well, well, come with me to my room. I will make you a
bed on the floor, and you shall sleep there."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure, Heaven will bless you; and if you knew all
you would forgive me, for I am not so bad as you think I am,
or as that woman thinks I am."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind what she says, she has a good heart after
all. Come, come along with me."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the like of it. She is going to take
that thing to her room, a miserable tramper; I dare say the
house will be robbed before morning. I will pick up the
spoons, and lock all the closets, before I go to bed again.
Dear me, did anybody ever see such a woman as that? She
never sees a woman in rags, but she wants to pull off her
shawl, and give her. I dare say, she won't let this girl out
of the house to-morrow till she has all her draggled clothes
washed and fixed up, and may be then will send for a carriage
to take her away. It is a great plague to anybody to
have such a tender heart. It is all the time getting them
into trouble.</p>

<p>"There, now I believe the silver is all safe, but mercy knows
what will become of this night's adventure. So much for getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
drunk. What does anybody want to get drunk for?
There was McTravers, the brute, always getting drunk. I am
sure, I love a little bitters to clear my throat in the morning,
and a glass or two of wine at dinner, and a little hot stuff as
I am going to bed, but as for getting drunk&mdash;bah&mdash;I hate
anybody that gets drunk. Oh, dear, this night air, I wish I
had not wasted all the hot water on the drunken dogs, for I
do feel as though I wanted a dram now, and no more water&mdash;what
will I do? I must take a little cold, or I shall not
sleep a wink to-night. Bah, how I hate drunkards."</p>

<p>What for, Mrs. McTravers, why should you hate your
own manufacture?</p>

<p>Let the reader reflect; there is a night before him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="h3">LITTLE KATY'S MOTHER.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A true devoted pilgrim is not weary,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To measure kingdoms with his steps."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Mrs. McTravers told me that Mrs. De Vrai had sent
a message for me, I was too weary to measure steps along a
few blocks; but when I read those three little magic words,
weariness had gone. Bridget thought so too. "He is gone,
ma'am." Yes, he was gone, gone abroad at midnight with a
merry heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A merry heart goes all day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your sad one tires in a mile."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>A mile was soon told, and I felt no tiring. Up this step
and that, peering at the blind numbers on the doors; how
could I tell one from the other? The almanac said there
should be moonshine at this hour, the clouds and rain put in
their veto. No matter, the almanac had said it, and that was
enough for the gas contractors. If the moon chose to get
behind a cloud, it was none of their look out. They would
not light their lamps, though darkness, thick, black darkness,
spread over the earth. Why should they? It was not in
the bond. So the traveller plodded on in the dark. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
could one see the numbers? Not by city light, but by city
license. Here burns a "coffee-house" lamp, where rum alone
is sold. More improvident than his city fathers, this one lights
up his lamp, of dark, rainy nights, whether the moon is in the
almanac, or city fathers' brains. His number is plain enough.
'Tis an even number&mdash;I am on the wrong side of the street.
Now, cross over, and here is, 47, 49, 51, 53&mdash;this must be it,
and yet it cannot be. It is a neat, two story, brick house,
with basement and attic, in a row of the same sort, in a clean,
wide street.</p>

<p>It is a very unlikely place for such a home as we have seen,
for the home of Little Katy's mother.</p>

<p>How, are we deceived again? It must be in the number;
perhaps we can not see it rightly by the dim glimmer of the
grog-shop lamp. It is the first glimmer that ever came from
such a place to any good.</p>

<p>There is no bell, but there is an old-fashioned iron knocker
upon the door; shall I use it; what if it wakes up some strange
sleeper and brings a fever-heated night-capped angry head out
of the upper window, with hasty words, perhaps cross ones of
"who is there?" I have no familiar "it's me," to answer.
No one will say, "wait a moment, dear, and I will open the
door."</p>

<p>All is still within. It were a pity to disturb the quiet
sleepers for nothing, nothing but the gratification of idle curiosity;
to make the inquiry if&mdash;if&mdash;Mrs. Mrs.&mdash;what was her
name? Now that is gone&mdash;faded from my memory as easily
as it was washed away from that paper. Whom could I inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
for? Should I inquire for "Little Katy's Mother?" I should
in all probability be told to go across the street and inquire
there, where I got my liquor, upon which to get drunk. Or
else, perhaps, to go home and inquire if my "mother knew
that I was out;" or told that she might happen to wake up,
and find her green gosling of a son gone&mdash;gone out in the
street to inquire after little girls' mothers&mdash;no doubt she would
be much alarmed. It was well that the moon was veiled, or
else the man in it would have seen how sheepish I looked as
I sneaked down the steps, with a weary step, that could not
have gone the half a mile without tiring.</p>

<p>How I did rejoice that no watchman was in sight to see
how crest-fallen I went away and stood up in the shade of a
lamp post! A few minutes afterwards, I would have given
gold for the sight of a brass star.</p>

<p>What for? Why did I not go home? What prompted
me to keep watch at that lamp post? My object in coming
had failed. I had acted upon the momentary spur of a nervous
temperament, heated into a state of excitement by what
I had seen in the early part of the evening, connected with
some of the scenes of the last few weeks' exciting life, which
had driven me, without consideration, to start off chasing an
ignis fatuus, in the swampy, Jack o'lantern producing air of
this city, and it had led me here and left me leaning against
a lamp post. Was ever poor wight led into a deeper bog?
"Go home," reason told us. If the lamp post had been a repelling
magnet, I should have gone. It was the contrary, and
I could not break the attraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p><p>That iron lamp post may possess a very strong magnetic
power, yet it is hardly possible, or probable&mdash;nay, it is very
improbable that it was that power which had drawn me
hither and kept me waiting "coming events."</p>

<p>They do "cast their shadows before," for the shadow, and
then the substance of a man came round the corner. Like
half of those who walk the streets at this hour, he was drunk.
Just then there was a moving light in No. 53. The intoxicated
night-walker caught the sight of it just as he came
opposite the lamp post, and he stopped and laughed one of
those horrid laughs, which give the blood a chill and send it
with a pang and fluttering fear to the heart.</p>

<p>The last sad remains of a gentlemen&mdash;no&mdash;a rou&eacute;, stood in
the dim light of a lamp which had been to him the guide to
ruin.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha, my old bird, you are astir I see. It is a long
time since I have seen you, but I have caged you at last.
You would not speak to me, ha, in Broadway, but I tracked
you home, and now I am going to roost in the old nest, or I
will blow you out of your fine feathers, my lady. Won't let
me in? Won't let me in? Then I will break in. Hold, here
comes a star. I'll keep dark while it shines." Back he went
around the corner, the star went carelessly onward down that
way, and I went eaves-dropping. I was impelled to do it. I
saw a light come in the front room and heard voices, and felt
that there was some strange connection between this house
and that man, and perhaps myself, and that the mystery must
soon be solved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>The blinds were closed, but the sash was up. I stood close
under the window, and the voices dropped down upon my ear
through the slats, clear and distinct as though I had been in
the room.</p>

<p>The light-bearer with a noiseless step, as though afraid of
awaking some sick sleeper, approached a bed, shading the
light with her hand.</p>

<p>It was no use. The timid start easy. There was a rustling-sound,
as though some one started up from an uneasy pillow
and sleep-disturbing dreams.</p>

<p>"Will he come?"</p>

<p>That voice, those words. Do I dream, or are there spirits
near? Oh, how familiar&mdash;how painfully familiar&mdash;reminiscential
of things past. What can it mean? But one voice
ever spoke those words in that tone, and that voice will never
speak again. The dreamer is in the street. It is my brain
that is disturbed. Hark! Again! I heard aright.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he will not come. Why should he? What am
I to him? Yet I wanted to see him a moment. It seems as
though it is he only who can protect me from that dreaded
man. Oh, Phebe, Phebe, what should we do if he were
to come here to-night? He has sworn to have revenge upon
me for leaving him; yet how could I live with a man who
threatened my life every day in his drunken fits? Long after
I went to Paris, he wrote to me that he would rob me of my
child&mdash;his child, if he died in the attempt. I long thought&mdash;nay,
hoped that he was&mdash;that is, that he never would return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
from Cuba. I heard of him in the dungeons of the Moro, and
now he is here."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I is sure he is here. Dat am de fact. Jis
sich man, stout, red face, black hair, and such eyes. I is sure
he is a wicked man."</p>

<p>"Only when he is drinking."</p>

<p>"Well, dat all de time wid some folk."</p>

<p>There was a groan of anguish in the bed.</p>

<p>"But, Phebe, you describe his looks just as I saw them to-day.
Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am&mdash;thought I wouldn't tell you though&mdash;but
it come out when I didn't know him."</p>

<p>"Where? Has he been here? Has he tracked me home?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, ma'am, when I goes to the door to let
Agnes Brentnall out, I sees him over the way, by de lamp,
and when she goes down the street, he walks after her, and
dat am last I see of him dis night."</p>

<p>"Poor girl, then she is lost. If ever he fixes his basalisk
eye upon her beauty, how can she escape. Poor girl&mdash;God
protect thee&mdash;man will not."</p>

<p>There was a sobbing that told of tears&mdash;tears that told of a
kind heart, crushed by a cold and careless world.</p>

<p>Then I was about to enter, but something said, "not yet,"
and I stepped down into the shadow by the high steps, till the
footfall I heard upon the pavement should go by.</p>

<p>It did not pass&mdash;it came directly up to the door, familiar
as a burglar with its night latch key. Why had they not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
bolted the door? It opened as though to one who had a
right to enter. The intruder&mdash;it was the dark-visaged man I
had seen five minutes before&mdash;closed the door gently after him
without latching it.</p>

<p>There was a thin lace curtain before the window, through
which, as I looked in between the slats of the blind, I could
see him as he approached the bed. Phebe had left the light
and gone into the back room. The lady had buried her face
in the pillows&mdash;nothing but her raven locks, hanging loose in
her neck, were visible. The villain looked at her for a
moment, then, satisfied that she was asleep, he reached over
her, and lifted a beautiful little girl from her side.</p>

<p>"Mother! mother!"</p>

<p>The light shone in her face&mdash;the mother started at the
appealing cry for help&mdash;sprang up&mdash;Heavens, what do we see?
It is little Sissee&mdash;Little Katy's sister and her mother!</p>

<p>What a sight for that mother! The man she so much
dreaded&mdash;the man who had so disturbed her dreams&mdash;with
her child, her last, her only child, in his strong arms, and no
one near to protect, to save.</p>

<p>She sprang towards him, and fixed her feeble hands in his
hair. Of what avail? He flung her from him reeling, fainting,
across the room. The noise brought the faithful Phebe from
her couch&mdash;too late. The mother saw her child disappearing
in the dark passage&mdash;she heard her screams for help&mdash;she
heard no more. One look of his terrible eye, as he bore away
her struggling child, was enough to kill one of a stronger form
than hers. One look of satisfied revenge&mdash;revenge of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
upon a feeble woman, and his hand is upon the door. One
step more and he is in the street. One step more and he
fell, beneath a blow of a stout cane in a strong man's hand,
and lay trembling across that threshold, quivering like a bullock
felled by the butcher's blow.</p>

</div>

<p>"Here, Phebe, take the child; take care of the mother;
tell her all is safe; the Lord watches over the truly penitent;
he will protect; he will save."</p>

<p>I dragged the unconscious mass of human flesh down upon
the pavement, and struck three sharp blows upon the stones,
with the broken cane&mdash;broken in avenging a feeble woman.
It was answered right and left, up and down, and again
repeated. I peered into the darkness for the coming
succor.</p>

<p>Will it come? Will it come in time? For a strong hand
has seized my only weapon, now he has it in his. There is a
momentary struggle&mdash;the prostrate man is up and the other
one down.</p>

<p>A large Bowie knife, the midnight prowler's fashionable
weapon, is gleaming at my throat. A moment more, and all
my debts were paid and duties done.</p>

<p>Moments fleet fast, but all too slow for the assassin's knife,
when it is not the will of Him that giveth life, that life should
fail. The knife fell, but not with a blow&mdash;it fell from a
broken arm.</p>

<p>The watchman's club had done the work. The watchman
had heard the call, and had come in time to save the avenger
and punish the assassin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take him away. You know me and where to send when
I am wanted. I have another life to save inside this house."</p>

<p>What was said or done need not be told. The reader is
dull of divining power, if he does not already know. I
cannot tell. I only know that I awaked from a short nap,
next morning, in an easy chair, with a sweet little girl, some
three years old, clinging her arms around my neck and nestling
her cheek up to mine. Had mortal ever sweeter dreams?</p>

<p>"What time is it, Phebe?"</p>

<p>"Don't know dat, sir; sun up yonder."</p>

<p>"Is it? And she sleeps quietly? Very well, let her sleep.
I will send a doctor, on my way home, to look at her. Good
by. Bon jour, Sis. One more kiss, there."</p>

<p>"You will come again, when mamma wakes up?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Good bye."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="h3">AGNES BRENTNALL.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Every inordinate cup is unblessed, and the ingredient is a devil."</p></blockquote>

<p>So it proved that night to Agnes Brentnall. But who is
she? That we have yet to learn.</p>

<p>We have only heard the name once, during the conversation,
between Madame De Vrai and the black woman, Phebe,
overheard in that eaves-dropping midnight scene described in
the last chapter, unless this Agnes is the same one that we
saw in a previous midnight scene, Perhaps it is, for now we
remember there was a Phebe in that. At any rate that name,
from both of these night scenes, had become deeply impressed
upon my mind, as belonging to a beautiful girl, followed in
the street by a night-prowling wolf, with a canine instinct
which snuffs in the breeze the far-off scent that leads him to
some wandering female.</p>

<p>Mrs. De Vrai had said; "Then she is lost."</p>

<p>What had become of her? Had the woman-devouring
monster consumed the innocent girl and come back for more
prey? He will prey no more, soon; he has met his deserts
at last. The stony walls of the Tombs' prison, will hold him
safe, and when he recovers from his broken arm, the law will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
have its course. He will make a good Sing Sing worker in
stone. It will not break his heart, for it is as hard as the
stone he will hammer.</p>

<p>But what of poor Agnes? Would that I knew. Did she
fall before his basalisk eye? Such thoughts were upon my
mind as I entered the door of the house I called my home,
after such a night of strange adventures as I have just made
the reader acquainted with.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" was the anxious question that
met me as I entered.</p>

<p>"What in the world took you out and kept you out all
night? Did you find that woman? How is she? Is anything
the matter? I do think you might write quite a
romance out of your adventures."</p>

<p>There is no occasion to write romance, it is only necessary
to give the real pictures of life&mdash;real scenes as they occur in
New York, to make up a volume more strange than wildest
romance.</p>

<p>"Where have I been? Where I saw strange sights.
Where it does seem as though some mysterious influence led
me, to meet with another adventure."</p>

<p>"You might have had one at home, sufficiently interesting,
I should think. A young girl, wickedly made drunk, for the
basest purpose on earth&mdash;'tis a horrid tale&mdash;you shall hear it
by and by&mdash;unprotected&mdash;alone in the street, at midnight&mdash;staggering
to and fro, chased like a dog by a crowd of boys
and half-drunken men, taking refuge in our basement area,
within ten minutes after you left the house."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>"You took her in? Yes, yes; I see, I see&mdash;a heavenly
deed produces a heavenly smile."</p>

<p>What was it shot through my brain? A thought. A
strange thought. What could have sent it there. Is it true?
We shall see.</p>

<p>"What is her name?&mdash;where is she? You have not sent
her away?"</p>

<p>"You shall see&mdash;come up-stairs. She is not up yet. She
has been distressingly sick&mdash;she is better now, almost well,
though very feeble. The doctor says, she was poisoned."</p>

<p>"No doubt, if drunk, of course she was. Every drop of
drunkenness-producing liquor is poison, of the most subtle
kind&mdash;slow, but sure."</p>

<p>She was still in bed. Her kind protector had furnished
her with a clean, white bed-gown and cap, and a prettier face,
indicating about sixteen or seventeen years, never looked up
smilingly from a downy pillow.</p>

<p>"She is very pale now. She vomited terribly all the latter
part of the night. Her color will soon come again."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am, I feel quite well now. Do let me get up
and dress myself, and go home&mdash;I cannot bear to be a trouble
to you any longer. Oh, sir, she has been a mother to me&mdash;more
than a mother&mdash;if I had such a mother&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my girl, never mind now. You cannot get
up yet. You must keep quiet to-day. To-morrow, we will
see you safe home."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I cannot possibly wait till to-morrow. What will
Mrs. Meltrand think?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"She shall know all about it before night."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! not all, not all! I should die with
shame."</p>

<p>"Well, then, only that you have been to see a friend, and
was taken very sick."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been to see a friend, a dear friend, a poor
unfortunate woman. Indeed, I must get up. She is sicker
than I am, and besides, I promised to go, too, and see a friend
for her. It is a gentleman that she thinks a great deal of,
sir,&mdash;one who was very kind to her when she was very bad,
and lived very miserably, and she thinks he was sent by Providence
to save her from total ruin. That, sir, was before
her little daughter died. Did you ever read about that, sir?
it was published in 'the New York Tribune.'"</p>

<p>"I do not know; that paper publishes so many stories. I
read the most of them. Then, you want to see Mr. Greeley.
You need not go there for that, you can&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, are you Mr. Greeley, then?"</p>

<p>"No, but I shall see him soon, and I will tell him what
you want. If it is to assist some poor distressed widow, you
may depend upon it, he will do all he can afford, for he is a
good man; his worst enemies acknowledge that."</p>

<p>"No, sir, it is not Mr. Greeley, that I am to go and see, it
is another gentleman in the office of his paper."</p>

<p>"Who is it? What is his name? I know all of the gentlemen
in that office; I can take your message to any one of
them, and will do so with pleasure. Is it Mr. Dana? he is
the next principal editor to Mr. Greeley."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, that is not the name. I cannot recollect it, now.
But he is one of the editors."</p>

<p>"One of the editors! Why, my girl, that paper has a
dozen editors. Perhaps, it is one of the assistants. Is it Mr.
Cleveland?&mdash;no&mdash;Mr. Snow?&mdash;no&mdash;Mr. Fry, Mr. Thayer?&mdash;no&mdash;Mr.
Ripley?&mdash;no&mdash;Mr. Ottarson?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not, but that sounds something like it."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear girl, there are a hundred men, editors,
reporters, compositors, pressmen, book-keepers, and all, in that
office; now, how are you going to find one that you do not
know, and say you have forgotten his name?"</p>

<p>"May be I shall recollect it when I get there. Don't you
know how names come back to us sometimes? Do you
never forget names?"</p>

<p>"Often, but I never forget faces. I have seen yours before,
but I have forgotten where, just as you have forgotten that
gentleman's name."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, have you? well, I do not remember your face,
but it does seem as though I had heard your voice, and, perhaps,
if the room was not so dark, I should know you. The
lady said, I must keep it dark, and sleep this morning. It is
no wonder that I should forget everything, I was so badly
frightened last night."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see how you are to find which one you wish
to see, among so many, unless you can recollect his name."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be easy enough, sir. I will ask one of the
gentlemen. I am sure any one of them will tell me, for I am
sure they are all gentlemen, real gentlemen."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not see what it is that you are to inquire for, or who,
or now to find, out which one, or anything about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, it is the one that wrote that little story about her
daughter."</p>

<p>"Her daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mrs. De Vrai's daughter."</p>

<p>A light began to dawn in my mind, and I said carelessly,
"her daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, her daughter. Little Katy, in that pretty story
of Hot Corn. She is Little Katy's mother, sir, and she wants
to see the gentleman that wrote that story. She did not
know his name until yesterday. She thought it was Mr.
Greeley, and he was out of town, and she had never seen him
since Little Katy was buried, and she had moved away from
where she used to live, without letting him know where she
was. Yesterday she found out her mistake, and sent Phebe&mdash;you
laugh&mdash;do you know Phebe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know Phebe, and I know you now; I know
you for a kind-hearted, good-natured girl. Your name is
Agnes."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, has Mrs. Morgan told you."</p>

<p>Now the reader is surprised. Yes, it is Mrs. Morgan&mdash;Athalia.
It was she that faced the crowd of savages that
cried "drag her out." It was she that took poor Agnes
in and gave up her own bed, and nursed and watched her all
night, and sent for a physician for her. It was Agnes, the
girl that you have seen in the picture with the negro wood-sawyer,
and at his home when Phebe divided her bed to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the poor girl a lodging. There is some goodness yet in human
nature. It was Phebe that Agnes went to see, while nursing
Mrs. De Vrai. It was the latter for whom she was now so
anxious to get up out of her sick bed, that she might go and
tell the gentleman who wrote the story of "Little Katy," that
Little Katy's mother was almost dying to see him. It was by
that token that she would find him.</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Morgan tell you my name."</p>

<p>"No, she has not told me; you told me that a long time
ago."</p>

<p>"Me, sir? Do you know me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, better than you do me. You have forgotten the
gentleman that stopped you in the street one night with old
Peter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me; yes, no, not forgotten, but I did not remember.
Oh, oh, how singular that I should come right here to
this house, where you live, and this dear good lady lives. Oh,
I wish I was good; but I am not a good girl. Oh, sir, has
this lady told you how bad I was last night? But it was not
all my fault, sir. If you only know, what a poor unfortunate
girl I have been&mdash;but sir, upon my word, I have not been what
folks call a <i>bad</i> girl."</p>

<p>"We believe you. There, don't cry, keep yourself quiet
to-day, and we hope to see you quite smart this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let me go and find that gentleman, for Mrs. De
Vrai. If you only knew what a good lady she is now, now
she don't drink any more. But I am afraid she won't live
very long. She has got a dreadful cough. And she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
worse last night, for she saw somebody in the street yesterday&mdash;some
man&mdash;a bad man&mdash;I believe they are all bad&mdash;no,
no, I don't mean all&mdash;but a good many of them."</p>

<p>"I am glad that the sight of bad men in the street, don't
make every lady sick who sees one; if it did we might turn
the whole city into a general hospital. But what about that
man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what, but she was dreadful 'fraid of him, and
that he would come where she lives."</p>

<p>"So he did, but he will not come again, soon."</p>

<p>"Then you know him, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And that is not all I know. I know you left Mrs.
De Vrai's last night about half-past nine o'clock, on your way
home; that soon after you started you were overtaken by a
stout-built gentleman, with black hair and black whiskers, who
said, 'Good evening, Miss, how did you leave Mrs. De Vrai,
this evening?'"</p>

<p>"Mercy on me, his exact words. Did you hear them? I
am sure I did not see anybody else near us at the time."</p>

<p>"No, I did not hear him&mdash;was not in that part of the city."</p>

<p>"He has told you then. I am sure I never did."</p>

<p>"No, neither have told me."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"What then? why, then you answered, 'Oh, sir, are you
acquainted with Mrs. De Vrai?'"</p>

<p>"So I did; why how strange that you should know it all."</p>

<p>"And then he began to talk to you about the danger of
such a pretty girl going home alone&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and then he offered me his arm; and, and, and I
thought as he was a friend of Mrs. De Vrai's I might take it,
and he said so many pretty things that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you were deceived by a villain, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, for mercy sake don't tell all before this dear good
lady, she who saved my life last night. Don't tell all."</p>

<p>"Why, Agnes, I cannot tell all. How do you suppose I
know all?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir, but I am sure you do. What is it
makes you know it; is it what they call animal magnetism,
or what is it? Are you a medium?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope so; a medium of glad tidings, that will bring
great joy to the world. But not a spirit medium, as they are
called."</p>

<p>"I don't know then how you know all about me, but I am
sure you do."</p>

<p>"No, I do not; I never saw you but once before, in my life&mdash;never
heard of you since except to hear your name mentioned
once last night, and that you had been at Mrs. De
Vrai's in the evening, and that that man followed you from
there, and I guessed his wicked purpose."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, wicked indeed."</p>

<p>"I know nothing more. I do not ask you either to tell
more, yet I believe it would be a relief to you to tell it, and
that it will be a burden off of your mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it will, it will; but I am afraid that you will not
believe me, or that you will despise me, or laugh at me for
being so simple, to be so deceived by a stranger; but then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
how could I tell that he was a bad man, and the streets so
dark?"</p>

<p>Poor child, could she have told any better if it had been
as light as noonday, that the soft-spoken, smiling gentleman,
with his sweet words, only used them to cover up a heart full
of bitterness and lying deceit?</p>

<p>"And so he told you he was an acquaintance of Mrs. De
Vrai's, a friend, and then he offered you his arm."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I thought I might take it&mdash;that it was so
kind of him&mdash;for he told me that he was just going in to see
her when he saw a lady come out, and he thought he would
step along and ask her if Mrs. De Vrai was up, and how she
was this evening, and if she had gone to bed, he would not
disturb her; perhaps too, he might be of service to a friend of
hers, by walking home with her. And then he asked me a
great many questions about Mrs. De Vrai, how long she had
lived there, and who lived with her, and who else lived in the
house, and about little Sissee; he asked such a heap of questions&mdash;if
she was pretty, and how big she was, and where
she slept, and where her mother slept, and oh! I cannot tell
you how many things; and then he told me how he knew her
in Paris, and what a pretty little girl she had&mdash;that was Katy,
sir,&mdash;and then I told him that Katy was dead, and then&mdash;but
I did not think of it then&mdash;he did not seem a bit sorry about
it, while I could not help crying, only thinking about it&mdash;and
that she should die just then too, when her mother was going
to be a good mother, and when some good men were just
going to begin to be good to her. Oh, sir, it was sad, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
sad for her to die then, was it not? But I suppose it is all
right&mdash;that everything is for the best&mdash;Mr. Pease says it is.
Do you know Mr. Pease&mdash;has Mr. Pease ever told you about
her; has he told you how Mrs. De Vrai used to live in the
Five Points, and how little Katy used to sell hot corn?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing, but never mind that now. You were going
to tell us about the stranger you were walking and chatting
with so cosily."</p>

<p>"So I will."</p>

<p>"Yes, so I was. But when I talked about Little Katy's
death, I got off my story. Well, sir, we walked on towards
Broadway, and he said we would go through Canal
street, it was lighter there, and so it was, a good many shops
were open, and all the places where folks go to drink, and
the ice cream saloons were open, and there were such crowds
of pretty girls walking arm in arm with nice gentlemen, looking
so proud and happy with their beaux, and I suppose I
looked just so, too, for I could not help thinking how poor I
had been, and now how well dressed I was, and that I had a
beau, too; and when I saw others going in to get ice cream
and good suppers, I almost wished&mdash;well, I did feel tempted
and I suppose all girls do, who see such things; and I suppose
he must have guessed what I was thinking of, for he
said, 'we won't go into any of those public places, there is a
nice place just round the corner&mdash;real genteel&mdash;it is the &mdash;&mdash;
Hotel&mdash;we will go there and have some ice cream and good
cool ice water&mdash;you don't drink anything else?' said he, sort
of inquiringly&mdash;'no, sir, not now, I have taken the pledge,'&mdash;'so
have I,' says he&mdash;'that is right&mdash;all girls ought to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
pledge.' So we turned up Broadway, and then I should think
just round one corner, but I don't know certain, it was so
light, and so many finely dressed gentlemen round the door,
and one of them said, 'look there, Jim, what a pretty girl
De V. has got; and that made me blush, and feel so confused I
did not know which way I went, and so I clung to his arm,
for I thought with him I was safe, and the first that I knew,
we were standing close behind some ladies and gentlemen
going in at a door&mdash;I saw 'private door' on it, and did not
quite like that, but I did not exactly know what it meant, and
hung back a little, and then he spoke so sweetly, and said,
'don't be afraid,' that I thought it was all right, or else what
would so many ladies and gentlemen go there for? So we
went in, and the gentleman says to the nice-looking waiter,
in his clean white apron, 'No. 6, Bill.'</p>

<p>"'No. 6 is occupied, sir, but I will give you another room&mdash;all
right.'"</p>

<p>'All right.' What could it mean? What could it mean
that most all the ladies I saw, wore thick, close veils, so that
nobody could tell who they were, old or young, ugly or
pretty? But I had not much time to think, for we walked
very fast through the passage, between I don't know how
many little private supper rooms, and pretty soon we went
into one ourselves. There was a table, four chairs and not
much else in the room. The waiter made the gas light burn
bright and then stood a moment for his order.</p>

<p>"'What shall it be, Miss&mdash;I do not recollect your
name.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>"How should he? I had never told him, he never knew it.
I answered, 'Brentnall.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes, Miss Brentnall, what shall we have?'"</p>

<p>How easy poor, weak girls are flattered. It was the first
time, perhaps, she had been thus addressed. What would she
have? She did not know.</p>

<p>"I was hungry, real hungry, and, so I told him, when he
insisted upon it, that I was so; and then he said, how fortunate
that two hungry persons should happen to meet, and that
they had come to such a good place, where they could get
everything that the heart could wish. Did I like crabs&mdash;soft
crabs&mdash;then we would have a supper of soft crabs. 'And I
say, Bill, while they are cooking, bring some ice water, a
chicken salad, and, let me see, you drink nothing but water,
I drink no liquor, no wine. Are you fond of Heidsick?' I
could not tell&mdash;I did not know what Heidsick was, only that
it was some kind of drink that the fellows used to call for at
that house where you saw Peter help me to get away from.
I thought it was some kind of soda water, it used to sparkle
and foam so, when they poured it out, but I would never taste
it then; I wish I had not now. I would not, only that the
gentleman said it was like water.</p>

<p>"'It is a sweet, pleasant French drink,' said he, 'not a drop
of spirit in it&mdash;about like ginger pop, or soda water&mdash;you will
see how it flies when I draw the cork.'</p>

<p>"It did fly and foam and sparkle, as he poured it out, and
looked so good. He handed me a glass with such a smile,
how could I refuse? How could I know I should break my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
pledge by tasting? It tasted so good, how could I help drinking.
The salad was very good, and that made the drink
taste better still, and so we eat and sipped, and sipped and eat
with a silver fork. It was delightful.</p>

<p>"After a while the crabs came, and then we eat them&mdash;how
good. Was it any wonder that so many come here to eat,
and drink 'Hiedsick?' And then the rooms were so quiet.
Still, the partitions are very thin, for I overheard a woman in
the next room say to a gentleman, 'now quit that, or I will
tell my husband. You had better not do that again.' And
then I heard a little scuffle, and then she said, 'Are you not
ashamed of yourself?'"</p>

<p>Why was she not ashamed of herself? She would have
been "mortified to death" to have her husband know that
she was in that room, eating late suppers and drinking wine,
at least, once a week. No wonder she wore a thick veil.
She was yet a little ashamed, for fashion's sake, ashamed to be
seen going into a private room, at ten o'clock, at night, with
a <i>cavalier servante</i>. She is on a quick voyage to a shameless
harbor, and will soon arrive there&mdash;perhaps, just such a harbor
as the home of Elsie Morgan, where the rats harbored
with her in the same cellar; or the home of little Katy, and
her mother in Cow Bay. She would have been ashamed to
have her husband know, that under pretence of going to
visit a sick friend, she had come with <i>a friend</i> to sup in a
"private room," in a "fashionable eating-house." So, too,
would that husband have been ashamed to have his wife
know, that under pretence of going to call on an old friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
at the hotel, he was actually, at that moment, enjoying himself
with that friend in the next room, and that that friend
was a friend of his wife, too&mdash;the fashionable Mrs. Smith,
whose husband is in California, toiling to earn money, which
he remits to her, which she is using to procure a divorce from
him, that she may marry a man she is already playing the
harlot with, and whom she will fool in the same way she
does her present poor simpleton of a husband. In fact, she
is already fooling her paramour, for she is here with another
man; and that man is the husband of a lady, whom she
addresses as her "dear friend." Ah, well! <i>C'est la vie</i> in
New York.</p>

<p>"So we sat and talked, and eat and drank, a long time,
for time went merrily on, and at last he poured out the last
of the good bottle, and we were just going to drink it and
go, for I said, 'I must go home, I have a good mile to go yet,'
and he said, 'Oh, I will see you safe home.' So as I was
lifting the glass, he caught my arm, and said, 'Stop, there is
a fly in it;' and he took my glass and began to look about for
something to take the fly out.</p>

<p>"'Oh, this will do.' And he took a little folded piece
of paper out of his pocket, and stooped down a little under
the table, as though to throw it on the floor."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Do you think he could have put anything in the glass out
of that piece of paper, just in the moment he had it? I
thought there was a bitter taste. I wish I had thought so at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
first. But I drank it, and then started to go home. When
I got in the street, I did not know which way I went. I
should have gone up Broadway, but we did not. Everything
seemed so strange. I felt as though I could fly almost. I
never felt so before. I clung to his arm, I could not walk
without it. I felt as though I could almost hug him. And
then he put his arm around my waist; I am sure I would not
have let him do that if I had known what I was about; and
so we went on, I do not know how far, or which way, but it
could not have been a great way, and then he went up to a
great fine house, with a silver plate on the door, with a name
on it in great letters, it was Phillips or Brown, or something,
only one name&mdash;just as though they were ashamed of the
other, or else did not want to be known, or something. I
said, don't go in there, what will the folks think? and he
said, 'Oh, this is a friend of mine lives here, a very nice lady,
and we will stop and rest a little while, and then I will go
home with you. I guess the Hiedsick has got in your head
a little, and we will go in here and wait awhile, till you feel
better.' Well, I did feel as though I could not go home,
until I got over my dizziness, and when he said, he knew the
folks, and that they were nice people, I thought I would go
in a few minutes. So he rung the bell, and then a woman
came and opened a little blind in the door, so that she could
see who was there, and then he said, 'Open the door, Leta,'
and then she said, 'Oh, is that you?' and then I knew he was
acquainted there, and in we went, and he whispered something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to her, and then she called the servant girl and told her
to show the gentleman up to No. 6. There it was, No. 6
again. And there it was again, for she said, 'there is a gentleman
and lady in No. 6 now; I will give them another,
all right.' I am sure, I never shall hear that word again
without believing it means all wrong. But I scarcely knew
right from wrong; I just held to his arm, and went wherever
he led me. It was a very nice room that she showed us in.
There were beautiful pictures on the walls; I could not see
very well what they were, but I thought they looked like
some I had seen once before, such as I am sure never should be
hung up anywhere. There was a great mirror, and marble-top
tables, and washstand, a very rich carpet, and such a splendid
bed, and chairs and rocking chairs, one of which I sat down
in, for I felt so tired and sort of sleepy; and then he told the
servant to bring in some water, and when it came, he poured
out a tumbler full, but I do believe it was half wine, and I
drank it down, and then I felt, oh, I never can tell how I felt,
or what happened after that; but I know more happened,
and that more was&mdash;was&mdash;what I never can tell."</p>

<p>"Villain, black-hearted villain; who laid his snares for a
poor, simple-hearted girl, to work her ruin. I wonder that
you ever got away, ever got out of that house. How did you
do it?"</p>

<p>"When I came to a little, I ran down stairs as fast as I
could go, and he ran after me, and cried, 'Stop her,' and two
other women ran out in the hall to do it, but just then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
door was opened, and two gentlemen were going out, and I ran
right into the arms of one of them, and he carried me clear
out, in spite of them, and then the other one said, 'Let her
go, she is drunk&mdash;now run.' I did run and they hallooed,
and then the boys took after me, and, oh, dear, you know the
rest."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps some of my readers have been sufficiently interested
to inquire, "Who is Agnes, and what of her?" Perhaps
there may be some, who, like Mrs. McTravers, think she is
not a proper character to introduce into a respectable family,
coming as she did from a house which gives an air of taint,
spoiled, lost, ruined, to every character that is found within
its walls. I am aware that there is room for suspicion, but
suspicion is not proof. In the case of Athalia, her acknowledged
sin is no more proof of moral turpitude than any other
act of a deranged mind. A lunatic may kill, yet it is not murder.
A drunken husband may beat his loving wife, and love her
still. It was not the man who struck the blow, it was the
demon Rum! It was not Athalia who lost her virtue, it was
the worse than demon who robbed her&mdash;intoxicated her&mdash;destroyed
her reason&mdash;enslaved her mind&mdash;but he did not,
could not, destroy her virtuous, benevolent heart. Her
conduct toward Agnes, is alone sufficient to prove this. And
if she had known as much as I did of Agnes, that there might
be some ground of suspicion against her, it would have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
no odds; she would have taken her in and taken care of her
in the same way, if she had known that she was a great
sinner; that is the true way to work reformation; and then
she would have said, "Go, daughter, and sin no more."</p>

<p>But she knew nothing against Agnes; even after I had told
her of the trunk, she said, all may yet be right. She was
unwilling to believe that all was wrong. How triumphantly
she met me as I came home in the evening&mdash;how a woman
does love to triumph over us in a good cause, proving herself
what she is in all the purest qualities of the heart,&mdash;our
superior.</p>

<p>"I told you so," said Athalia. "I knew there had been
some base deception, some wickedness practiced towards that
poor girl to inveigle her into that house. Come up stairs, and
you shall hear her story from her own lips; she is quite smart
now, and able to sit up and talk, and looks so pretty&mdash;she is
pretty, and that has been the great cause of her trouble. But
she is a good girl; I have heard a good deal about her to-day,
besides what she has told me. Phebe and Peter, have
both been here, and such a meeting, oh! it would have done
your heart good to have been here, and to see these poor
blacks' conduct towards this girl, after I had told them the
story of her adventures last evening: they hugged her, and
kissed her with as much affection as though she had been one
of their own; and then Peter went to see the lady where she
had been living, at the place he got for her, the next day
after your first interview with her, and the lady was terribly
alarmed about the poor girl, and so she would not let Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
come back until she had the carriage up, and then she took
him in&mdash;only to think, such a sweet, nice, pretty lady did not
feel herself in the least disgraced to ride with a poor, old,
negro wood-sawyer in her fine carriage, to visit a poor sick
servant girl. And so she came, and such a time! why, if she
had been her own child, she could not have been more
affectionate. And then Agnes told us her story, and then I
told Mrs. Meltrand, that is her name, about Mrs. De Vrai, and
how that same man, who treated Agnes so badly, tried to steal
Mrs. De Vrai's little girl, and then she said, 'how singular,'
and then of course I said, what is so singular?"</p>

<p>"Ah me, it is a long story, and would not interest you, but
I was robbed of a dear little girl, fifteen years ago, in England,
by just such a man, in just the same way, but it could not
have been this man, his name was Brentnall."</p>

<p>"Brentnall, why that is my name," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Your name, why you never told me that before."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, you never asked me, and I did not suppose that
you cared to know anything about me, only that I was a
good girl, and did your work well, and answered to the name
of Agnes."</p>

<p>True. How little interest we all take in our servants;
they come and go and we never know that they have any
name but one that is most convenient to call them by, and
we take no interest in them, hardly enough to know that
they possess souls as precious as our own.</p>

<p>"And so, your name is Brentnall, what was your father's
name?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am, as I ever had any, or mother either."</p>

<p>"But you must have had both."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I suppose I must, to have been born, but I mean
I never saw any."</p>

<p>"Where did you live, and who brought you up?"</p>

<p>"I lived with an uncle, near Belfast, and came over with
him and his family, and every one of them died of ship fever
on the voyage, and when I landed here in this great city, I
was utterly alone, and almost penniless. Oh dear!"</p>

<p>"And then Mrs. Meltrand, said, 'Oh dear,' and she went
away feeling sad. I do wish I knew what it could be in that
name that made her feel so sad. Some reminiscence connected
with the loss of her little girl, I suppose. It is very
sad, to lose a child by death, it must be very much more sad
to have one stolen away, and never know what becomes of it,
whether dead or alive; and if the mother should meet her
own child in the street not to know it; but dear me, how I am
running on while you are eating your supper, as though you
had nothing to think of but the things that interest me so
much. But if you have been able to eat while I have been
talking, come up to my room and see my prot&eacute;g&eacute; and hear
her story."</p>

<p>So we went up, and found the invalid almost recovered,
looking so sweet, for she looked grateful, and that, when it
beams out like the sunlight, will make any face look beautiful.</p>

<p>"I told you," said Mrs. Morgan, "about her landing here
penniless and alone, and I want she should tell you&mdash;there
now, there is the bell, how I do hope that is uncle&mdash;yes it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>&mdash;it
is; do you hear him talking to Bridget? that is his step,
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now the door opens, and now she is in his arms, and now
there are more questions than answers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When did he arrive? How did he find things out West?
Has he been to supper? What is the news?"</p>

<p>"Now you are a perfect woman, you are enough to confuse
a whirlwind. Sit down, and be quiet, and I will tell you all
that you need to know. But first tell me who is this young
lady; you forgot to introduce me."</p>

<p>"So I did, but of course she knows by this time that you
are my uncle, and you will know directly all about her, for
she was just going to tell part of her story, and I shall tell
the rest before you go to bed."</p>

<p>"I will warrant that. Perhaps you would like to hear
mine, and where I have been since I arrived."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, do tell me, and why you did not come right
home?"</p>

<p>"I have been to jail, since I arrived; locked up in the
criminal cells. It is a little singular too, how I got there.
It is all owing to the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Owing to the newspapers, uncle, I do not understand how
the papers should get you in prison."</p>

<p>"Very well I do. I saw an item in one of them this
evening, about the arrest of a person whose name struck me
very forcibly as being that of a man whom I once knew in
Europe, and who I was very anxious to see, for I felt the
deepest interest to know what had become of his wife. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
him I cared nothing, I knew he was a villain, and felt rejoiced
to think he had met his deserts at last; but his wife was a
sweet good woman, a victim of unfortunate circumstances all
through her life, and when I saw her last I had reason to fear
that she was falling into a course adopted by many, many
others, of drowning sorrow in wine. But I shall not tell my
story now; I will sit down and hear yours."</p>

<p>"Well then, Agnes, tell what you did after landing."</p>

<p>At the sound of her name, Mr. Lovetree gave a little start,
and said, "Agnes! oh, pshaw!" and sunk back again in his
easy chair, as though he had been affected by the name, and
thought it very foolish that he had been so. Agnes, said:
"Indeed, ma'am, I don't think the gentlemen will be at all
interested to hear anything about me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I have promised them."</p>

<p>"Well, then, after my uncle died, and all my friends, I felt
dreadful; it is dreadful for a young girl to be left all alone in
a strange country. So when the ship landed, or rather when
she came to anchor, the people from shore came aboard, and
I saw how many of the poor emigrants had friends to welcome
them, and that I had none; it was then that I felt the
dreadful loneliness of my situation, and I sat down and cried,
for I could not help it, and then a man came and spoke to
me very pleasantly, and asked me where I wanted to go, and
all about it, and then I told him all my troubles, and then he
said it was the luckiest thing in the world that I had met
with him, for he was an emigrant agent, appointed by law,
and he would take charge of me and take me ashore to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
boarding-house, and do everything for me. And then he
asked me how much money I had, and I told him that I had
but a few shillings, of my own, but that I had three gold
sovereigns that were my uncle's&mdash;he had more, a great deal
more, when he died, but somebody must have taken it away&mdash;and
that was all I had in the world besides their chests of
clothes and things. And then he said, that it was very lucky
for me that I had that, for he would have to pay half a
guinea head-money for each passenger, no matter how many
were dead, and then he would have to pay the custom-house
duty, and the wharfage and the cartage, and the week in
advance for the board, and that would take all the money
and more too, but he would pay that and hold the things
until I could pay him back. So I gave him the money, and
he got the chests, all but my trunk, I would keep that, and
took them ashore, and took me to a boarding-house, and that
was the last I ever saw of him, or the money or chests either,
he had robbed me of all of my poor uncle's things, and my
three gold sovereigns; so the landlady said, and he never
paid her a cent of board. I did not know what to do; I was
willing to work, but how should I find a place. The landlady
said, I must go to the 'Intelligence office.' I thought I
should like to go somewhere to get intelligence of the man
who had run away with my things, or any other intelligence
that would be of any benefit to a poor stranger in this great
Babel of a city. And I asked her to tell me the way to the
'Intelligence office,' and I went there. It was a great room,
divided into two parts; one was full of men, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
of girls, sitting on long benches. I went in and sat down
among them, and I suppose, I looked sad&mdash;I felt so, and I
felt worse when I heard some of the girls snickering, and
overheard them say, 'there is a green one.' If that was an
'Intelligence' office, I thought it a very queer way of giving
it to one so much in need of it as I was. After a while, one
of the girls came and sat down by me, and spoke kindly, and
asked where I came from, and a good many questions; I
was almost afraid to answer her, for fear that she was 'an
emigrant agent,' too, and had some plan to cheat me, or practice
some deception, but I became convinced in a little while
that she meant kindly; and then I told her all about myself.
Then, she said, that I must get my name registered. I did
not know what that was for, but I went up to the bookkeeper,
and told him my name, and age, and where I came
from, and what I could do, and he wrote it all down in a
book and then told me to give him half a dollar, and when
I got a place I must give him another one; I did not know
what for; he gave me no intelligence about how I was to get
a place, but he told me to go and sit down again. So I did,
all that day and all the three next days, waiting for somebody
to pick me out of the lot. Every hour, somebody came
and looked over all the girls, for all the world just as I have
seen the people do in the pig-market, at an Irish fair, until
they found one that would suit. One objected to me
because I was 'green;' another, because I had never been at
service in this country; another, because I had no recommend;
and then a girl whispered to me, and told me she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
knew a man who would write me just as many recommends
as I wanted, for a shilling a piece. If that is the way recommends
are made, I don't see what good they are. At last,
after being looked over day after day, like a lot of damaged
goods, a lady, at least, I thought she was a lady, selected me
the very first one, and for the very reason that twenty others
had rejected me&mdash;because I was too good-looking. When she
found that I had no friends in this country, and no father or
mother in the world, she seemed still more anxious to have
me, which I thought so kind of her, and then she told me
that the work would be very light, only some rooms to take
care of, and wait upon company a little, and she knew I
should like the place; I thought I should; I did at first, but,
I don't want to tell, before the gentlemen, why I did not like
to live there; this one knows already."</p>

<p>"Well, well, you need not tell, we understand all about it.
You have been treated just as a great many poor girls without
friends have been treated before in this city; and you got
just as much intelligence, and just as much profit from
your application to the 'Intelligence office,' as a great many
others have done before you."</p>

<p>Now, it was Athalia's turn to tell her uncle all that she
knew about Agnes, and then he told about his visit to the
prison.</p>

<p>"I found," said he, "the very man I expected, or rather
hoped, it might be, and it is well that I acted upon the
impulse of the moment, for if I had not, I should have been
too late. It is the doctor's opinion, that he will not live till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
morning. It seems that he got into some difficulty with the
police last night, and one of them, to prevent him from stabbing
another man, broke his arm."</p>

<p>There was a little start of surprise on my part, and that of
Mrs. Morgan; but we made no interruption, and Lovetree went
on with his story. We thought, though, we could not help
that.</p>

<p>"I expect he had been drinking hard, for he tore off the
bandage from his arm in the night, and when the keeper
opened his cell this morning, he found him almost dead with
loss of blood and vital prostration. He cannot live. They
had aroused him, and I found him quite rational when I went
in, and was immediately placed beyond all doubt as to the
identity of the man, for he called me by name the moment
he saw me."</p>

<p>"I am glad you have come," said he, "I can trust you,
and I want to make a clean breast of it before I die. My
wife and child&mdash;my last one&mdash;are in this city, and when I am
gone, I want you to go and see her, and tell her, that I shall
never trouble her any more; she will be glad to hear it, for
she saw me last night, and I left the old lady somewhat in a
fright. I cannot tell you the exact number, but I can tell you
so that you can find the house easy enough. It is in W&mdash;
street."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I cannot stand it any longer," said Mrs.
Morgan.</p>

<p>"Cannot stand it? I don't see anything that you cannot
stand. You surprise me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not half as much as you surprise us. We know all
about it. It was him," and she pointed to me, "that knocked
the ruffian down; it was him that he was about to stab when
the watchman broke his arm; and it is she, uncle, Mrs. De
Vrai, his wife, who is the mother of Little Katy; now, you
know all about it; we know all about it."</p>

<p>"No, not all, for he told me, that he believed his other wife
was in this city, also, married here, and he wanted that I
should look her up, too; and tell her where, perhaps, she
may find her child."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said he, "that I left it with my brother, near
Belfast, an Irish farmer, by the name of William Brentnall."</p>

<p>"William Brentnall!" said Agnes, her eyes opening with
wild surprise.</p>

<p>"I do think," said Mr. Lovetree, "that I have lost my
senses, or else some of the rest of you have. First, one, and
then the other, fairly screams out some exclamation as
though I were a conjurer, and you could cot comprehend
my words or actions. Have you done now, shall I go on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, uncle; I am dying with curiosity, and as for
Agnes, she looks the very picture of wonder."</p>

<p>"Indeed I feel so."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't understand why, but I suppose I might as
well proceed. 'Tell her,' said he, 'that he is well known
and easily found, and that I left the child with him, telling
him that it was mine, and that its mother was dead.' Then
I was a little surprised, for I thought his name was De Vrai,
'but that,' he said, 'was an assumed one, the name by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
he married the woman that I knew, because he dared not
marry her by his own name. Then, I asked him what was
her name, who I should look for, and who she should inquire
for, to find her child? Then he took a little card out of his
pocket, as though he would write her name, and then he
seemed to recollect his broken arm, and said, with a groan,
'my writing days are over, and all my days nearly.' Then, he
told me, to take the card and write, and so I did, here it is&mdash;'this
is the mother's name, and this is her daughter's, upon
the truth of a dying man&mdash;tell her so, beg her to forgive
and forget the dead.'"</p>

<p>"What are the names? Do tell us, uncle."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Meltrand&mdash;Agnes Brentnall."</p>

<p>Now there were at least two screams and one, "Oh how
wonderful!"</p>

<p>Then Agnes said, "Mrs. Meltrand my mother!&mdash;that is
wonderful!"</p>

<p>Then Mr. Lovetree looked surprised; all around him seemed
to be a mass of mystery. Others began to see through it, he
was now in the dark.</p>

<p>Athalia explained. There was one point that she was not
quite clear upon, and she asked her uncle if Agnes was really
De Vrai's daughter, or only Mrs. Meltrand's?</p>

<p>"His own. Mrs. Meltrand, was his lawful wife when he
married Mrs. De Vrai."</p>

<p>"Oh my God! then Agnes is his own child."</p>

<p>None spoke&mdash;what each thought sent a thrill of icy horror to
every heart. All groaned or wept, none could speak. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
are moments in life of speechless agony, when the mind is
completely horrified, when anything that breaks the silence
comes as a relief. It came now in the sound of the door
bell. It was a messenger to Mr. Lovetree. It brought relief
to aching minds. It was very short. It only said, "he is
dead." It is perhaps wrong to rejoice at the death of a fellow
creature, but we could not feel regret.</p>

<p>After the first flush of excitement was over, a note was
written to Agnes's mother, simply stating that if she would
call at Mrs. Morgan's at her earliest convenience, she would
meet with an individual who could tell her of her long-lost
daughter. She made it convenient to come immediately,
though it was then ten o'clock at night.</p>

<p>It is not reasonable to suppose that she could keep away
till morning, particularly as she had heard a word or two at
her first visit which left her mind uneasy.</p>

<p>I drop the curtain upon the scene when the mother
acknowledges and receives to her arms her long-lost daughter,
while I go to carry comfort to the heart of Mrs. De Vrai, the
ill-treated wife&mdash;the widow of a villain&mdash;the mother of his
child, soon to be an orphan.</p>

<p>What a load it lifted from her crushed heart, when I told
her those three little words&mdash;"he is dead."</p>

<p>"Then my child will be safe, at least from his evil influences."</p>

<p>What a dreadful thing it is for a wife to feel upon the
death of her husband that she is safe herself, that her child is
safe, more safe among strangers than with its own father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Why should she feel so? Why does she feel so? The
answer is still shorter than that which gave her relief&mdash;which
told her that her child's father was dead. That was composed
of three words, this of one. That one word is&mdash;Rum!!</p>

<p>It was that which made a villain of him, a double villain to
two wives and the children of both. It was that which made
him attempt the greatest wrong that a father can do to his
own child. Poor Agnes!</p>

<p>It was that which drove Mrs. De Vrai step by step from the
paths of peaceful, youthful innocence, comfort and affluence, to&mdash;but
I will not name the intermediate steps&mdash;to that wretched
abode where the little girl who sold Hot Corn, and slept in
the rain upon the cold stones, breathed her pure life away in
prayers to that mother not to drink any more of that soul
and body destroying rum.</p>

<p>It was that mother, who, upon her death bed, prayed me
to tell the world the fruits that the traffic in rum produces.
"Tell them to look at me, at my history, or a brief view of
it; its details would fill a volume. Tell mothers to watch
their daughters. Tell those who bring up children in hotels
and public houses, that they are rearing their daughters to
one chance of virtue, against ten of sin and woe. My mother
was left early a widow, with a competence to raise her two
daughters 'at home,' yet she seemed to delight in the excitement
incident to a life in a hotel or great boarding-house.
As children, we were petted and spoiled; as misses, we
learned all that girls usually learn in such boarding-schools
as fashionable mothers send them to; as young ladies, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
were the flattered of fops and rou&eacute;s, and our mother allowed
us to be in a constant flirtation at home, or out every night to
parties, balls, soir&eacute;es, theatres, concerts, and then to saloons,
late suppers, and wines, and&mdash;oh dear!&mdash;what if I had had a
home and a mother to keep me out of temptation; but I had
not, and I met with the fate almost inevitable.</p>

<p>"Among the boarders at the hotel, where we stopped at
Saratoga, was an Englishman, who claimed, and I believe
rightly, to be one of the nobility, for he wrote his name, Sir
Charles R&mdash;&mdash;, and had a well-known coat of arms upon his
seal, which he used publicly. Of course, I was flattered,
proud, vain of the attentions of an English nobleman, young,
handsome, full of money, and ardent in his professions of
love, which I have no reason to think of otherwise than as
sincere; I was seventeen, tall, straight, handsome form, face,
and figure, and always dressed with taste. My eyes were
black; cheeks, rosy; and hair like the wing of a crow. I
was well bred, and well read, and could talk and sing to captivate.
So could he, and we were both equally affected.
When we left the Springs, he came with us to New York,
and put up at the same hotel. Then I was innocent. Oh,
mothers! mothers! how long can you answer for the innocence
of your daughters who go to fashionable eating and
drinking saloons, and leave them after midnight, with their
young blood on fire, and in such a state of mind that they
hardly know whether they go home to rest in their own
room, or in some of the thousand traps for the unwary, in
almost every street in the city?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, mothers, mothers, every one,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With daughters free from sin,<br></span>
<span class="i0">How can you look so coldly on<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ways from virtue daughters win?<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Late suppers and wines, and constantly seeing others, who
should set the young better examples, going the road that
ruins virtue, had its effect. If I had been properly restrained
by my mother, had been kept at home nights, and never
learned to sip fashionable intoxicating drinks, my mother
would not have mourned 'a girl lost.'</p>

<p>"A few months after my first acquaintance with Sir
Charles, I was living with him in a richly furnished house, in
Eighteenth street, shamelessly passing as his wife, and
treated as such by our acquaintance, although they knew
that I was not. It was here that Katy was born, and
received her first impressions of home and a fond father's
love. Here I lived away my young womanhood in fashionable
dissipation, and then Sir Charles died suddenly, and
without a will. He had always said, he would make a will,
and give his vast property to me and our child. But he put
it off, as many others do, one day too long. Why do men
defer this duty? A sacred duty to those they leave behind
them, of their own flesh and blood. I knew, as his wife, I
had rights; and I went to England to try and obtain them.
I left my elegantly furnished house, which cost, I don't know
how many thousand dollars to furnish, for my mother and
my sister, and an uncle to occupy while I was gone. I found
all the property in the hands of Sir Charles's brother, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
was unwilling to give up the share that rightfully belonged to
his wife and child, because he said, we could not recover it by
law. He did not say why, my conscience did. As a compromise,
if I would give him a general release, he offered five
thousand pounds. I would have taken it, but I had employed
a lawyer, and he hooted at the idea; he looked for more
than that for his fee when he recovered the full amount. I
told him that I had no marriage certificate, and that the
minister who married us was dead. So he was; Sir Charles
was dead. I did not tell him that no other ever blessed our
banns. I told him, that numerous persons would swear that
they had heard him call me wife, and Katy his child. He
said, that would do. I did not know that our opponents
could produce as many more to swear, that they had heard
Sir Charles say, that it was only a marriage of convenience.
So, for an uncertainty of five hundred thousand as a mere
prospect, I refused the certainty of five thousand, and went to
law. The evidence stood so balanced that the judge could
not decide. 'Let the wife be sworn. Let her say, upon her
oath, that she was married to Sir Charles, and the case will
be given in her favor.'</p>

<p>"There was a chuckling laugh just behind me, the tones
of which went to my heart, and I fainted. It was De Vrai.
He had known me in this city, and persecuted me with his
importunities while Sir Charles was living. I had turned
him off with a promise, all too common, 'when Sir Charles is
dead.' Then he renewed his importunities, and I told him, to
wait a respectful time. He followed me to England, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
still pressed me, and I still put him off. He had hinted several
times that if I recovered the suit, he well knew that he
should lose his. It was him that furnished my opponent
with a clue to the proof that we were never married. It
was him that laughed in my ear when the case rested upon
the question, whether I would swear that I was married or
not. For a moment, for the sake of my child, I was
tempted; that laugh recalled me partially, and I was carried
away in a litter, and the case adjourned. For aught I know
it still remains adjourned.</p>

<p>"De Vrai followed me to my hotel. I was in a state bordering
upon distraction. With a foolish pride, to keep up
appearances, as the wife of Sir Charles, I had exhausted all
my means, and run awfully in debt. I had written to my
uncle, in New York, to sell my furniture at auction, and send
me the money. After a long delay I got five hundred dollars,
and a very short letter, saying, that was all the nett proceeds.
I felt, I cannot tell how. I knew I was cheated, and
wrote a bitter letter back. Then, my own friends, those who
had fawned around the rich mistress of Sir Charles, cast off
the poor woman struggling to recover something for his
child. In this she failed, because that child was not born in
wedlock.</p>

<p>"I was now poor indeed. What could I do, alone in a
strange land? I knew that De Vrai had no affection for me,
only such as one animal has for another, but in my despair
I married him.</p>

<p>"His means of living were derived from the same source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
that hundreds of well-dressed gentlemen derive theirs from,
in this city. He was a gambler; a genteel gambler. Such
as you may find in every hotel in New York, in every public
place, dressed in the very best style, living in the most expensive
manner, with no trade, occupation, or exercise of mind
or skill, except the skill of cheating at card playing.</p>

<p>"At first, we lived pleasantly; but pleasures with such men
are short-lived, and must be often changed. If successful in
business&mdash;that is what they call their nefarious employment&mdash;they
are all smiles and affection to wife and children; but
if 'luck is against them,' they are the most unhappy men in
the world, and make everybody else unhappy around them.
As for enduring conjugal affection, I believe the excitement
of a gambler's life renders them incapable of feeling its influence.
I can scarcely tell how the months passed which I
lived with that man, for I drank wine to excess every day.
Not to become intoxicated; only just fashionably excited.
We lived in the best style of hotel life, often at the expense
of the proprietors.</p>

<p>"A little before Sis was born, De Vrai met with 'a run of
luck,' and we took a cottage out of town, and lived very
comfortably for a year, upon the proceeds of that 'windfall.'</p>

<p>"What that run of luck was, may be guessed at from the
following extract from a morning paper:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Suicide.</span>&mdash;An American gentleman was found dead in his bed, at
his lodgings, this morning, and it is supposed he died from poison,
administered by himself, in consequence of immense losses at the gaming
table, not only of his own money, but a sum which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>received in trust for a widow and orphans, in America. It is said,
that he owes his losses to the wretched practice of drinking to intoxication,
and that he was fairly robbed while in this condition, by a
companion of his, one who made great pretence of friendship. He
leaves a beautiful young wife, 'quite destitute,' 'tis said."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I did not know then that this companion of his was my
husband. I found that out afterwards, and that he was more
than robbed.</p>

<p>"Soon after that event, De Vrai brought the widow of his
victim to live in our house. I was the wife&mdash;she the
mistress. I was blind at first, but I soon had my eyes
opened. Opened not only to that fact, but that that wife had
stood behind her husband's chair while he played with the
villain who robbed him, and gave the signal of what cards
he held; and afterwards, when he became sober enough to
realize his ruin, she proposed that they should take poison,
and die together.</p>

<p>"The result need not be told, only that he died and she lived.</p>

<p>"When I made these discoveries from an overheard conversation,
I ordered the vile woman from my house.</p>

<p>"'My house, my house, ha, ha, you poor simpleton. Every
article in this house and every cent of money that you or
your husband has on earth belongs to me, and these are the
papers.</p>

<p>"'Now if you behave yourself you can stay here, if not, you
will have to tramp, both of you.'</p>

<p>"She shook the papers in my face, and laughed at my look
of fear and astonishment. To finish my agony, when I began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
to talk something about the rights of an English wife, she
coolly told me that she had just as good a right to my husband
as I had, for he had one wife when I married him, and that
rendered my marriage a nullity. What a shock for a wife&mdash;to
hear that she is no wife, or if she is, the wife of a
robber, adulterer, and murderer.</p>

<p>"I heard all this with a sort of indifference foreign to my
very nature. It was well that I did, for it enabled me to perfect
my plans, and carry them out with a degree of coolness
worthy of a better purpose. I had been promising for some
time to visit a friend for a week, and I set about packing up
for the journey at once. I said not one word to De Vrai of
what I heard, nor gave him one look of reproof. Fortune
had made me acquainted with the secret hiding-place of the
money this guilty pair had obtained from their poor victim,
and I did not feel any compunctions of conscience in taking
it from them. In three days afterwards I was in Paris.
Here I lived a few months a wretched life of dissipation,
and then De Vrai, tracked me to my hiding-place and I had
to fly once more; this time across the ocean.</p>

<p>"I had five hundred dollars when I arrived in this city.
What might I not have done with that sum, if I had used it
prudently? What I did do, I must tell, that it may be a
warning to others. It would be a source of consolation to
me if I knew that the follies of my life could be illuminated
and set up as a beacon light to my fellow creatures, to save
them from the quicksands of dissipation upon which I have
been wrecked&mdash;wrecked by my own folly and foolish pride.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was pride, foolish wicked pride, that led me to go to a
fashionable hotel, and put up, with my two children and nurse,
as Madame De Vrai, from Paris. How soon five hundred
dollars melt away, even with prudent living, at a New York
hotel. I did not live prudently. I drank to excess, gave late
suppers, and gambled. This could not last long, though
many hundreds of the dollars worse than wasted in those few
weeks, were won from others equally guilty of this besetting
wickedness and folly with myself. Such a life could not
last. My first step down was to a cheap lodging in Crosby
street. I cannot tell how I lived there. I only know that
my valuables, my clothes, everything went to the pawnbroker,
and I went to that wretched hole where you first saw
me in Cow Bay, from whence I drove my poor little Katy out
in the streets at midnight, to sell Hot Corn. It was there
that my poor child died. It was there that you received her
dying blessing, and I her dying forgiveness for all the wrongs
that I had heaped upon her poor innocent head. It was then
by her death that I was awakened to consciousness and I felt
and saw my own deep soul and body destroying degradation.
It was through her death and translation to a home in heaven,
that I have obtained a hope that my Father may forgive
what my child has forgiven, and that, I may yet see her again.
It was Him, it must have been Him that opened your ear to
that little plaintive cry of 'Hot Corn,' that rose up through
your window on its way to the home of angels watching
over a child whom her mother had forsaken.</p>

<p>"It was His power&mdash;no earthly power could have aroused my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
mind from its lethargy, that awakened me one moment before
it was too late. It was a bitter trial, but nothing else but the
death of that sweet child would have been sufficient to save
her wicked mother; I cannot mourn her loss, because I feel
that she is now so much better off than while singing her
nightly cry through the streets, of 'Hot Corn, Hot Corn, here's
your nice hot corn!' Speaking of singing, have you seen the
new song, just published, called 'The Dying Words of Little
Katy, or Will He Come?"</p>

<p>"The music of this, as it is arranged for the piano, is one

<p>"And besides that, there are a good many other songs and

have been if my poor child had not been called away from

<p>If those who would reform the vicious, knew the power of
love and kind words towards the poor fallen creatures who
abound in our city, and how much stronger they are than
prison bars, how much more powerful than handcuffs, fetters
and whip lashes, we should soon see the spirit of reformation
hovering over us like the guardian angel sent to save a city
that should be found to contain only five righteous persons.</p>

<p>My readers may remember the slight glimpse they had of
the face of Julia Antrim, on two occasions&mdash;once as a street
walker, only thirteen years old, dressed in borrowed clothes,
or rather in garments furnished by one of the beldams who
keep the keys of our numerous city pandemoniums, where
innocence is entrapped, and virtue sold at a discount; and
again a year or two later, when the fiend who said "our
trade," laughed to see her dragged out of one of the underground
dens where demons dwell, where rum is sold and
souls destroyed, on her way to prison, and the termination of
a career, to which one half, at least, arrive at, who take the
first step&mdash;false step&mdash;in the same road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning she was "sent up:" a short phrase which
means imprisonment for six months in the city penitentiary.
Penitentiary!! What is a penitentiary? A place of repentance
and reformation.</p>

<p>Ours is a place to harden young offenders, or rum-made
criminals&mdash;to make them worse rather than better. It made
Julia Antrim worse. It was the work of the missionary, and
the benevolent heart of Mr. Lovetree, and the kind words of
Mrs. May and Stella, that effected what dungeons, fetters
whips, and harsh language could not.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Morgan to me one evening, "such a story
as my uncle has been telling me; do tell him, uncle, about one
of those 'Five Point girls,' rescued from one of those miserable
dens."</p>

<p>"You remember the girl," said he, "that you saw dragged
out of the cellar for picking her paramour's pocket? Come
with me and you shall see her and hear her own story.
Athalia, come put on your hat and go with us. You know
how glad Mrs. May and Stella always are to see you."</p>

<p>They were so this evening. Stella was in the front shop
busy with her pins and needles, threads and tapes, and all the
numerous little articles of necessity which go to make up an
assortment, for which she had a demand that not only kept
her busy, but also a fine bright active little boy. He is on
the road to wealth and manhood now. He was on the road
to ruin once. He was the son of a drunken father, who
taught him to "prig" and sell the stolen articles for rum.
The reader has seen him before. Would you like to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
where? Turn back to page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>&mdash;look at that picture of
the fireman rescuing two children from the flames. This
bright boy is the child of drunken Bill Eaton. How Stella's
eyes did sparkle as she saw us enter; far more than they
would to see her best customer, for now she saw her best
friend, her kind patron, who gave her the means to gain
good customers.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, mother, here is Mr. Lovetree and Mrs.
Morgan, and that other gentleman!"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. May's eyes sparkled, for "she was so glad to see
us"&mdash;she was always glad to see us. She was very busy in
the little back shop, working away, and she had two very
neat-looking industrious girls at work with her. We have
seen both of them before. One of them for the first time on
the steps of the Bank of the Republic, clothed in a poor
dirty ragged dress, with that same little boy, sickly and
pale, leaning upon his sister for support, and keeping her
company as the two wandered through the streets, making
midnight melodious with that ever pealing summer cry, of,
"Hot corn, hot corn, here's your nice hot corn, smoking
hot, smoking hot, just from the pot, all hot, hot, hot!"</p>

<p>She will sing, it no more. She is in a better situation now
for a little girl than midnight street rambling; that is not the
best school for young girls&mdash;we have seen how near the brink
of ruin it led Sally Eaton.</p>

<p>She was rescued just in time&mdash;just before she was lost.
Two great calamities fell upon her in one night. Her father
was killed, and her mother's house was burned, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
poor widow and her two children in the street, naked, except
one garment, amid the crowd that came to look upon what
she then thought the wreck of all hope. It proved her
greatest blessing; for in that crowd were those who took her
in, and clothed and fed, and sent her children to school, and
taught her girl how to work; and, finally, placed her as a help
to another widow, where she will soon learn and earn enough
to help herself. The other girl, who is now working with her
old companion, was once her street associate in rags and
wretchedness; afterwards, her envied, because better clothed,
acquaintance. We saw her too, upon the same evening that
we first saw the little Hot Corn girl driven away from her
hard seat upon those cold stone steps&mdash;less cold than the
heart of the great world towards its outcast population. We
saw her again, just where we then knew that her course of
life would lead her&mdash;to intoxication,&mdash;wretchedness&mdash;crime&mdash;prisons,
and&mdash;no, she stopped just short of death, and returned
to virtue, industry, and happiness.</p>

<p>After the heartfelt, happiness-giving congratulations of
Mrs. May, Stella, Sally Eaton, and "Brother Willie," were
over, I turned to a nice, modest-looking young girl and said,
"and who is this? What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Julia Antrim, sir."</p>

<p>Did I dream? No, I did not dream, I looked upon sober
reality. It was the poor outcast, whom I had seen dragged
away from the underground abode of all that is bad, to "the
Tombs," and from whence she went to "the Island," and as I
heard, from there, at the expiration of her noviciate, to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
of the lowest, most degraded, worse than beastly, abodes of
those who have only the form of humanity remaining. So I
told her I had heard, and she replied,</p>

<p>"True&mdash;where else could I go? I could go nowhere but
there. I came out of prison with only the clothes they gave
me there, with my hair cropped&mdash;branded, to tell all the world
to beware of me&mdash;that I was a 'prison bird.' If I desired,
and I really did, to return to a virtuous life, the door was
for ever closed against me. I went back to Mrs. Brown's, the
woman who had first tempted me, with fine clothes and
jewelry, to sin&mdash;to that house where I lost all that a poor girl
has on earth&mdash;her virtue&mdash;where I had sinned and profited,
as the term is, by sinning; where I had left piles of rich
clothing, and pretended friends. I knocked at the door, once
so ready to open for my first admission, and that too was
closed in my face with an oath, a horrid, wicked woman's
oath, bidding me to go away or she would send a policeman&mdash;I
knew the policeman would do her bidding&mdash;to take me
away as a common street vagrant, coming there to disgrace a
'respectable house.' I went away, dispirited, broken-hearted,
and sunk down into that wretched abode in Anthony street,
where I was found by Mr. Pease, and actually compelled,
much against my will, to go to the Five Points House of
Industry, where I was washed, and clothed, and fed, and
sobered, furnished with work, and, above all else, taught to love
God and pray, and, for the first time in more than two years,
to feel one moment of happiness.</p>

<p>"When I was with those wretches in that miserable hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
where Mr. Pease found me, I really thought that my heart
had got so bad, that it could not, would not, ever be good
again.</p>

<p>"How I did use to curse and hate everybody that was good.
That good man who saved me at last, I hated worse than all
others. All who are like what I was then, hate him and
fear him more then they do all the prisons and police in the
city. If somebody would publish the truth, or only half the
truth, of what I alone know of the crime and misery about
the Five Points of New York, and how much good all the
good men have done who have devoted themselves to the
reformation of those wretched human beings, I do think that
everybody with a good heart would buy the book, and thus
contribute a mite to aid the good work&mdash;a work that saves
from a life worse than death, scores of children and young
girls, lost to every virtuous thought or action; lost to all hope
in life or eternity.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," and she seized me by the hands in her energy,
"you can write&mdash;Stella has told me how you can write&mdash;that
you have written some powerful stories; pray write more,
more, more; the world will read, and it will do a world of
good."</p>

<p>"Well, Julia, if I write, I must have characters and names,
to fill up the incidents of my Life Scenes, shall I use yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, if it will do good, and save others."</p>

<p>"And mine." "And mine." "And mine." "I think,"
said Mrs. May, "that the incidents connected with Athalia's
life, would alone make quite a volume; would you have any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
objection to having them written out and published, Mrs.
Morgan?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might consent, if it was well done, if it would
serve as a beacon to save others from being shipwrecked upon
the same desolate shore where I came so near being totally
lost; only escaping by the smallest chance, and by one of the
most singular interpositions of Providence, and through the
efforts of one of the weakest instruments. It is to Stella, first
of all that I owe my present happiness. It was through her
that all my friends became interested for me. In fact, if it
had not been for her, my dear uncle would never have known
where to find me."</p>

<p>"Rather give the credit to a higher power; that power
which gave him the kind benevolent heart that beats in his
breast; that disposition to watch over the young and guard
the innocent, which led him to take an interest in my poor
child. Let us be grateful to all the humble instruments of
Him who giveth every good and perfect gift to man, but to
Him to whom we owe all of our present happiness, be the
final praise."</p>

<p>Now there was a little space of silence; a time for reflection;
all were too full of thought, holy, happy thought, to
speak. It is good to think. The world is generally too
much given to act without thinking. Mr. Lovetree was not.
He thought that we had agreed to visit Mrs. De Vrai, on our
way home, "but before I go," said he, "I want to invite you
all to dine with us next Sabbath. I want to see our little
party of friends all together, for a certain purpose."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle always has a little surprise to play off upon his
friends. I am afraid this is not a pleasant one, or else he
would not have chosen Sunday."</p>

<p>"I chose that," said he, "because I know how difficult it is
for the laboring poor to give a day from their working time,
for any kind of recreation. I assure you that this will be a
pleasant surprise, though not an inappropriate one for the day,
for I intend to have a minister with us to ask a blessing upon
our food."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Stella, "I can guess it."</p>

<p>Young girls are always ready to guess as she did. She
guessed it was to be a wedding. She guessed that Mrs.
Morgan was going to be married. Then the others guessed
so too. Mrs. Morgan guessed not. She was sure she could
not get married without somebody to have her. Of course
not. But Stella thought that "somebody" would not be very
hard to find. She knew a gentleman that liked her well
enough to marry her.</p>

<p>At any rate, that the party was to be a wedding one was
pretty well settled. Whether the bride will be Athalia or
not we shall see. So then, after lots of "good night" and
"do come again soon," we parted, and went on our way to
visit the sick and dying victim of fashionable dissipation,
which led her through a rapid career of a few happy months,
and then through years of woe, from wine at dinner, to
"cobblers" at late suppers, and bitters in the morning; till an
appetite was acquired which could only be satisfied by constant
libations of anything that would intoxicate, procured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
any means, however debasing, till she ceased to be a lady;
almost ceased to be a woman; quite forgot that she was a
mother; else how could she have driven that poor little innocent
child out upon the streets, murky and damp, with her
cry of "Hot Corn, hot corn, all smoking hot!" while the poor
child was chilly, cold, and starving?</p>

<p>Poor girl&mdash;poor little Katy! Thy mother loves thee now.
Look down from thy blest abode&mdash;it is thy mother calls, it is
thy voice she hears, and she answers, "Yes, yes I will come."</p>

<p>"She is better, sir," said Phebe, as we entered the door.
"She has been sitting up a good deal, and she talks of going
over to your house to-morrow, Mrs. Morgan; she says she
must go out, and take the air, or she never will get well."</p>

<p>This was pleasant news, and it quite elated Mrs. Morgan.
Mr. Lovetree gave one of his peculiar expressions of countenance
as soon as he saw her, which told as plain as though he
had spoken it, that she never would go out again but once,
that would be a ride which all must, none are willing, to take.</p>

<p>We were all very much delighted to find Mrs. Meltrand and
Agnes, with Mrs. De Vrai. Mrs. Meltrand, ever since she had
first seen her, had fallen in love with little Sissee, the sweet
little Adaleta, and this evening Mrs. De Vrai, had made her a
final promise, that if she should not get well, Mrs. Meltrand
should have her for her own; and she had promised to adopt her
and make her as much her child as though she was really so.</p>

<p>"But what is the use of talking? I don't feel any more
like dying than you do. I am almost well. My cough has
quite gone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>But a bright crimson spot upon each cheek had not gone,
and that told its own tale. Adaleta was delighted with sister
Agnes. She could hardly bear to part with her. She will
not, but her mother must. How little any one would have
thought, as we parted that evening, leaving the invalid so
cheerful and full of hope, that we had parted for the last time.
No! not the last time&mdash;may we hope for one more meeting?
Let us now retire to our chambers and prepare for that meeting.
Let us say to the reader, as we said to the poor sufferer,
"Good night. God be with you!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chapter">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_THE_LAST" id="CHAPTER_THE_LAST"></a>CHAPTER THE LAST.</h2>

<blockquote><p>All things must have an end.</p>

<p>Where there is true friendship, there needs no gloss to our deeds, no hollow
welcome to real friends.</p></blockquote>

<p>"By and by" is easy said; it means an uncertain time, but it
comes at last. It came to Mrs. De Vrai, only a few hours
after our last parting. Phebe came with the early morning
to say, "She is gone, sir; gone to meet her poor child in the
hope of the penitent. After you went away, she lay and
talked and talked about you, all of you, and Mrs. Meltrand
and Agnes, and how happy she should be if she was a going
to die, to think that her child would have such a good mother
and sister, and so many real friends; and how different it
would be with herself now, here and hereafter, as well as her
child, than it would have been if she had died in her former
residence of wretchedness, sin, and woe. Then I asked her if
she would take her medicine and go to sleep, and she said;
'by and by, not now; I feel so well, so happy, I can almost
fancy that I see my poor little Katy in heaven among the
angels. I often see her here in the room when I am laying
with my eyes closed, but not asleep; and I often think I hear
her dying words, "Will he Come!" and I say "yes, he has
come; the Saviour has come, my child, to your mother."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Then she says, "then come, mother, come and live with us;"
and I answer, "by and by." By and by, Phebe I shall go,
but not yet, I am going to get well now.'</p>

<p>"So I went and lay down in the back room, and I heard
nothing of her, though I got up and looked at her a good
many times, but she seemed to be sleeping so sweet, I thought
I would not wake her to take her medicine&mdash;the doctor said I
need not. In the morning I got up, and looked in the room,
and there was Sissee sitting up in the bed, trying to open her
mother's eyes; then she would put her arms around her neck
and kiss her, but there was no kiss in return. Then she sat
back and looked at her a minute, and then called&mdash;'Phebe,
Phebe, mamma does not speak, oh Phebe, is mamma dead!"</p>

<p>Yes mamma was dead. She had died as calm and free
from pain and full of joy as when she said "good night" to her
friends. She had died full of anticipation that she was going
to live to get well; that she would not join the spirit of Little
Katy now, but by and by: by and by she would come.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Drop a tear, drop a tear, for she's departed!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wreath a smile, for she died not broken-hearted.<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was on Friday morning. On the Sunday following,
the intended party met at Mrs. Morgan's and partook of an
early dinner. "For," said Mr. Lovetree, "we have a good deal to
do this afternoon. In the first place, some of our friends are
disposed to be united in the holy, the blessed bonds, that bind
the sexes together in a union that should be indissoluble, and
productive of nothing but happiness. After that we have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
duty to perform, which though it is generally termed melancholy,
must not be made so on the present occasion. We
shall go to deposit the body in Greenwood, that lovely place
of rest for the dead, of one who we have every reason to
believe died a true penitent, and is now with the spirit of
Little Katy, where those who are murdered by the same cause
that produced her death, will seldom ever be found. Our
good missionary is with us, and we will have the wedding
ceremony before the funeral one, because many go from that
to the grave, none come from there to the marriage feast."</p>

<p>Now all began to look around for the happy couple. Mrs.
Morgan was dressed as though she might be a bride, but
where was the groom? Mr. Lovetree whispered to Mrs.
Meltrand, for she was there with Agnes and little Sis, and
Mrs. Meltrand said that Frank would be there by the time.</p>

<p>"Now what Frank is that?" said Stella in a whisper to
Mrs. May; "it must be Frank Barkley; and so it is Mrs.
Morgan that is going to be married. Oh, dear, I am sorry, I
was in hopes she would always live with her old uncle, as she
does now."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> Frank Barkley who was expected. He was an old
acquaintance of Mrs. Meltrand, a little wild in his youth, and
came within an inch of the precipice over which so many
young men tumble. Mr. Lovetree had said, "there is something
good in the fellow," and between him and Mrs. Meltrand,
it was developed. He is a good fellow&mdash;a sober fellow
now&mdash;and he is going to be married. Now the door bell
rings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>"There that is him."</p>

<p>Yes, it was him. He was told that all were waiting for
him, and he said "he had come to the minute agreed upon."
Poor Stella shed tears. She cried to think her dear friend,
Mrs. Morgan, was about to be married. She cried without a
cause.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovetree said to Frank, "allow me to introduce you
to my niece, Mrs. Morgan."</p>

<p>He started back from her, rubbed his eyes, and looked
again. Stella rubbed hers. She was convinced now that they
were not to be married. Poor Frank looked confused and
in doubt. He approached near enough to Mrs. Morgan to
whisper, "Lucy," to which she replied, "Yes," and he said,
"God bless you then," and turned away to meet his bride.</p>

<p>This was Agnes. And he took her by the hand, and led
her up to the minister who was to pronounce them man and
wife, and said&mdash;"Now, sir, we are ready." Then a couple,
who were to act as bridesmaid and bridegroom's attendant,
took their stations upon the floor. It was the opinion of all
present that they would act as principals in a similar scene
by and by.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader would like to know who this neatly-dressed,
bright couple are, for he has seen them several times
before. It is one of Mr. Lovetree's oddities that you see
them now. You have seen them when they would not be
very fitting guests in a parlor, but they wear wedding-garments
now. This is Tom, who held the cup of cold water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
to the lips of the dying Madalina, and this is his reward. The
neat, lovely girl at his side is Wild Maggie&mdash;Miss Margaret
Reagan. The fine-looking hearty man that is leading up a
well-dressed woman to the altar&mdash;another couple to be married&mdash;is
one of the former customers of Cale Jones's grocery.
It is Maggie's father. His bride is Mrs. Eaton. We have
seen her and her two children in some of the early scenes of
this volume. We saw them in the street then&mdash;we see them
in the parlor now. We see them much better, much happier
this time, and we see them just as we might see all the
laboring class, if we could abolish the traffic in rum from the
world. There are two other couples here to bear testimony
to that fact. It was the particular request of Reagan and
Maggie that they should be present to witness and rejoice
over the power of the pledge to save. We have seen both
these couples stand up to be married before the same minister
who is now saying the solemn words of the marriage ceremony
to those before him. You may see them as they were
when you first saw them, if you will turn back to the plate
facing the "Two Penny Marriage."</p>

<p>Julia Antrim and Willie Reagan act as attendants upon
this last couple, and Sally Reagan and Stella May, dressed in
pure white&mdash;dresses of their own make&mdash;with wreaths of
flowers in their hair, made by their own hands&mdash;served the
company with cakes and fruits and tea and coffee. Then the
carriages came to the door, and all went&mdash;not to a tavern, or
drinking saloon for a riot, to commemorate the most serious
event of life, but in all soberness due to the occasion, to consign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the remains of poor Madame De Vrai to her final resting-place
on the earth.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant drive to Greenwood Cemetery, and it is a
pleasant place for the tombs of our friends. It is a good
place to go to meditate, among the new-made graves in the
fresh-turned earth, and among the proud monuments of those
who have lain long enough beneath their marble coverings
to be forgotten. I did not forget to look, as I passed along, at
the rose bush which I saw planted by a widow at the grave
of her rum-murdered husband. It was growing fresh and
vigorously.</p>

<p>Now we stand around the open grave that is soon to be
filled by another victim of a trade that feeds scores and
starves millions&mdash;that saves one life and causes a thousand
deaths&mdash;that consigns youth, innocence and beauty, equally with
old age, to a premature grave. Now we lower this last victim&mdash;still
young, beautiful, intelligent, full of sweetness of disposition
and kindness of heart&mdash;into her grave. Now we look at the
little cherub, the darling, sweet, much loved Adaleta, her
orphan child, and now at her sister's grave, then at the weeping
circle, who stand and sob as the falling clods bring forth
that hollow sound, never heard in any other place. Now the
voice of him who says: "'Tis the last of earth," "Let us
pray," breaks the charmed circle of intense silence.</p>

<p>Why is every eye upturned at the close? Did each listening
ear fancy it heard the sound of an angel's voice in the air,
breathing the words,&mdash;"Will he Come?" "Will he Come?"</p>

<p>And did they expect to see the face of Little Katy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
clouds, looking down upon those she loved, paying this tribute
to her mother, now sleeping by her side in the grave; now
with her child in the spirit land of the blest?</p>

<p>Among the many poetical effusions which have been
elicited by reading the story of "Little Katy," I think the
following, which appeared in the New York Tribune, will be
read with pleasure. It is from the pen of Mrs. B. F. Foster,
of New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With dizzy whirl, on rushed the wheels<br></span>
<span class="i0">Along the City's murky street,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And music's light, inspiring peals<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rang out from folly's gay retreat;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And busy footsteps hurried past,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And human voices, harsh and wild,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Commingling, floated on the blast;<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the shrill accents of a child<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rose mid the din, in tones forlorn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, "Come, buy hot corn, hot corn!"<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like some sad spirit wafted by,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger to the ways of earth,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Sweet discord to the sounds of mirth.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unheeded by the reckless crowd,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There stood a girl, a pale, wan thing,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And 'neath her bosom's tattered shroud<br></span>
<span class="i0">There lurk'd an age of suffering;<br></span>
<span class="i0">While e'en till night approached the morn,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In feebler voice, she cried, "Hot Corn!"<br></span>

<span class="i0">Till all insensible she grew,<br></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
